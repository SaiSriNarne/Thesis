0	I spent the past three years talking to some of the worst people on the internet.
1	Now, if you've been online recently, you may have noticed that there's a lot of toxic garbage out there: racist memes, misogynist propaganda, viral misinformation.
2	So I wanted to know who was making this stuff.
3	I wanted to understand how they were spreading it.
4	Ultimately, I wanted to know what kind of impact it might be having on our society.
5	So in 2016, I started tracing some of these memes back to their source, back to the people who were making them or who were making them go viral.
6	"I'd approach those people and say, ""Hey, I'm a journalist."
7	"Can I come watch you do what you do?"""
8	"Now, often the response would be, ""Why in hell would I want to talk to some low-t soy-boy Brooklyn globalist Jew cuck who's in cahoots with the Democrat Party?"""
9	(Laughter)
10	"To which my response would be, ""Look, man, that's only 57 percent true."""
11	(Laughter)
12	But often I got the opposite response.
13	"""Yeah, sure, come on by."""
14	So that's how I ended up in the living room of a social media propagandist in Southern California.
15	He was a married white guy in his late 30s.
16	He had a table in front of him with a mug of coffee, a laptop for tweeting, a phone for texting and an iPad for livestreaming to Periscope and YouTube.
17	That was it.
18	And yet, with those tools, he was able to propel his fringe, noxious talking points into the heart of the American conversation.
19	For example, one of the days I was there, a bomb had just exploded in New York, and the guy accused of planting the bomb had a Muslim-sounding name.
20	Now, to the propagandist in California, this seemed like an opportunity, because one of the things he wanted was for the US to cut off almost all immigration, especially from Muslim-majority countries.
21	So he started livestreaming, getting his followers worked up into a frenzy about how the open borders agenda was going to kill us all and asking them to tweet about this, and use specific hashtags, trying to get those hashtags trending.
22	And tweet they did — hundreds and hundreds of tweets, a lot of them featuring images like this one.
23	So that's George Soros.
24	He's a Hungarian billionaire and philanthropist, and in the minds of some conspiracists online, George Soros is like a globalist bogeyman, one of a few elites who is secretly manipulating all of global affairs.
25	Now, just to pause here: if this idea sounds familiar to you, that there are a few elites who control the world and a lot of them happen to be rich Jews, that's because it is one of the most anti-Semitic tropes in existence.
26	I should also mention that the guy in New York who planted that bomb, he was an American citizen.
27	So whatever else was going on there, immigration was not the main issue.
28	And the propagandist in California, he understood all this.
29	He was a well-read guy.
30	He was actually a lawyer.
31	He knew the underlying facts, but he also knew that facts do not drive conversation online.
32	What drives conversation online is emotion.
33	See, the original premise of social media was that it was going to bring us all together, make the world more open and tolerant and fair ... And it did some of that.
34	But the social media algorithms have never been built to distinguish between what's true or false, what's good or bad for society, what's prosocial and what's antisocial.
35	That's just not what those algorithms do.
36	A lot of what they do is measure engagement: clicks, comments, shares, retweets, that kind of thing.
37	"And if you want your content to get engagement, it has to spark emotion, specifically, what behavioral scientists call ""high-arousal emotion."""
38	"Now, ""high arousal"" doesn't only mean sexual arousal, although it's the internet, obviously that works."
39	It means anything, positive or negative, that gets people's hearts pumping.
40	So I would sit with these propagandists, not just the guy in California, but dozens of them, and I would watch as they did this again and again successfully, not because they were Russian hackers, not because they were tech prodigies, not because they had unique political insights — just because they understood how social media worked, and they were willing to exploit it to their advantage.
41	Now, at first I was able to tell myself this was a fringe phenomenon, something that was relegated to the internet.
42	But there's really no separation anymore between the internet and everything else.
43	This is an ad that ran on multiple TV stations during the 2018 congressional elections, alleging with very little evidence that one of the candidates was in the pocket of international manipulator George Soros, who is awkwardly photoshopped here next to stacks of cash.
44	This is a tweet from the President of the United States, alleging, again with no evidence, that American politics is being manipulated by George Soros.
45	This stuff that once seemed so shocking and marginal and, frankly, just ignorable, it's now so normalized that we hardly even notice it.
46	So I spent about three years in this world.
47	I talked to a lot of people.
48	Some of them seemed to have no core beliefs at all.
49	They just seemed to be betting, perfectly rationally, that if they wanted to make some money online or get some attention online, they should just be as outrageous as possible.
50	But I talked to other people who were true ideologues.
51	And to be clear, their ideology was not traditional conservatism.
52	These were people who wanted to revoke female suffrage.
53	These were people who wanted to go back to racial segregation.
54	Some of them wanted to do away with democracy altogether.
55	Now, obviously these people were not born believing these things.
56	They didn't pick them up in elementary school.
57	A lot of them, before they went down some internet rabbit hole, they had been libertarian or they had been socialist or they had been something else entirely.
58	So what was going on?
59	Well, I can't generalize about every case, but a lot of the people I spoke to, they seem to have a combination of a high IQ and a low EQ.
60	They seem to take comfort in anonymous, online spaces rather than connecting in the real world.
61	So often they would retreat to these message boards or these subreddits, where their worst impulses would be magnified.
62	"They might start out saying something just as a sick joke, and then they would get so much positive reinforcement for that joke, so many meaningless ""internet points,"" as they called it, that they might start believing their own joke."
63	I talked a lot with one young woman who grew up in New Jersey, and then after high school, she moved to a new place and suddenly she just felt alienated and cut off and started retreating into her phone.
64	She found some of these spaces on the internet where people would post the most shocking, heinous things.
65	And she found this stuff really off-putting but also kind of engrossing, kind of like she couldn't look away from it.
66	She started interacting with people in these online spaces, and they made her feel smart, they made her feel validated.
67	She started feeling a sense of community, started wondering if maybe some of these shocking memes might actually contain a kernel of truth.
68	A few months later, she was in a car with some of her new internet friends headed to Charlottesville, Virginia, to march with torches in the name of the white race.
69	She'd gone, in a few months, from Obama supporter to fully radicalized white supremacist.
70	Now, in her particular case, she actually was able to find her way out of the cult of white supremacy.
71	But a lot of the people I spoke to were not.
72	"And just to be clear: I was never so convinced that I had to find common ground with every single person I spoke to that I was willing to say, ""You know what, man, you're a fascist propagandist, I'm not, whatever, let's just hug it out, all our differences will melt away."""
73	No, absolutely not.
74	But I did become convinced that we cannot just look away from this stuff.
75	We have to try to understand it, because only by understanding it can we even start to inoculate ourselves against it.
76	In my three years in this world, I got a few nasty phone calls, even some threats, but it wasn't a fraction of what female journalists get on this beat.
77	And yeah, I am Jewish, although, weirdly, a lot of the Nazis couldn't tell I was Jewish, which I frankly just found kind of disappointing.
78	(Laughter)
79	Seriously, like, your whole job is being a professional anti-Semite.
80	Nothing about me is tipping you off at all?
81	Nothing?
82	(Laughter)
83	This is not a secret.
84	"My name is Andrew Marantz, I write for ""The New Yorker,"" my personality type is like if a Seinfeld episode was taped at the Park Slope Food Coop."
85	Nothing?
86	(Laughter)
87	Anyway, look — ultimately, it would be nice if there were, like, a simple formula: smartphone plus alienated kid equals 12 percent chance of Nazi.
88	It's obviously not that simple.
89	And in my writing, I'm much more comfortable being descriptive, not prescriptive.
90	But this is TED, so let's get practical.
91	I want to share a few suggestions of things that citizens of the internet like you and I might be able to do to make things a little bit less toxic.
92	So the first one is to be a smart skeptic.
93	So, I think there are two kinds of skepticism.
94	And I don't want to drown you in technical epistemological information here, but I call them smart and dumb skepticism.
95	So, smart skepticism: thinking for yourself, questioning every claim, demanding evidence — great, that's real skepticism.
96	Dumb skepticism: it sounds like skepticism, but it's actually closer to knee-jerk contrarianism.
97	Everyone says the earth is round, you say it's flat.
98	"Everyone says racism is bad, you say, ""I dunno, I'm skeptical about that."""
99	"I cannot tell you how many young white men I have spoken to in the last few years who have said, ""You know, the media, my teachers, they're all trying to indoctrinate me into believing in male privilege and white privilege, but I don't know about that, man, I don't think so."""
100	Guys — contrarian white teens of the world — look: if you are being a round earth skeptic and a male privilege skeptic and a racism is bad skeptic, you're not being a skeptic, you're being a jerk.
101	(Applause)
102	It's great to be independent-minded, we all should be independent-minded, but just be smart about it.
103	So this next one is about free speech.
104	"You will hear smart, accomplished people who will say, ""Well, I'm pro-free speech,"" and they say it in this way that it's like they're settling a debate, when actually, that is the very beginning of any meaningful conversation."
105	All the interesting stuff happens after that point.
106	OK, you're pro-free speech.
107	What does that mean?
108	Does it mean that David Duke and Richard Spencer need to have active Twitter accounts?
109	Does it mean that anyone can harass anyone else online for any reason?
110	You know, I looked through the entire list of TED speakers this year.
111	I didn't find a single round earth skeptic.
112	Is that a violation of free speech norms?
113	Look, we're all pro-free speech, it's wonderful to be pro-free speech, but if that's all you know how to say again and again, you're standing in the way of a more productive conversation.
114	Making decency cool again, so ... Great!
115	(Applause)
116	Yeah.
117	I don't even need to explain it.
118	"So in my research, I would go to Reddit or YouTube or Facebook, and I would search for ""sharia law"" or I would search for ""the Holocaust,"" and you might be able to guess what the algorithms showed me, right?"
119	"""Is sharia law sweeping across the United States?"""
120	"""Did the Holocaust really happen?"""
121	Dumb skepticism.
122	So we've ended up in this bizarre dynamic online, where some people see bigoted propaganda as being edgy or being dangerous and cool, and people see basic truth and human decency as pearl-clutching or virtue-signaling or just boring.
123	And the social media algorithms, whether intentionally or not, they have incentivized this, because bigoted propaganda is great for engagement.
124	Everyone clicks on it, everyone comments on it, whether they love it or they hate it.
125	So the number one thing that has to happen here is social networks need to fix their platforms.
126	(Applause)
127	So if you're listening to my voice and you work at a social media company or you invest in one or, I don't know, own one, this tip is for you.
128	If you have been optimizing for maximum emotional engagement and maximum emotional engagement turns out to be actively harming the world, it's time to optimize for something else.
129	(Applause)
130	But in addition to putting pressure on them to do that and waiting for them and hoping that they'll do that, there's some stuff that the rest of us can do, too.
131	So, we can create some better pathways or suggest some better pathways for angsty teens to go down.
132	If you see something that you think is really creative and thoughtful and you want to share that thing, you can share that thing, even if it's not flooding you with high arousal emotion.
133	Now that is a very small step, I realize, but in the aggregate, this stuff does matter, because these algorithms, as powerful as they are, they are taking their behavioral cues from us.
134	So let me leave you with this.
135	You know, a few years ago it was really fashionable to say that the internet was a revolutionary tool that was going to bring us all together.
136	It's now more fashionable to say that the internet is a huge, irredeemable dumpster fire.
137	Neither caricature is really true.
138	We know the internet is just too vast and complex to be all good or all bad.
139	And the danger with these ways of thinking, whether it's the utopian view that the internet will inevitably save us or the dystopian view that it will inevitably destroy us, either way, we're letting ourselves off the hook.
140	There is nothing inevitable about our future.
141	The internet is made of people.
142	People make decisions at social media companies.
143	People make hashtags trend or not trend.
144	People make societies progress or regress.
145	When we internalize that fact, we can stop waiting for some inevitable future to arrive and actually get to work now.
146	You know, we've all been taught that the arc of the moral universe is long but that it bends toward justice.
147	Maybe.
148	Maybe it will.
149	But that has always been an aspiration.
150	It is not a guarantee.
151	The arc doesn't bend itself.
152	It's not bent inevitably by some mysterious force.
153	The real truth, which is scarier and also more liberating, is that we bend it.
154	Thank you.
155	(Applause)
0	I have two passions: first football.
1	I am a super fan, let's see if you can guess the team.
2	(Laughter) I am of course, a Real Madrid fan.
3	I am also a goalkeeper at the Villanubla football club.
4	My other passion are computers, video games and programming, which is what I am going to talk about today.
5	During playtime, we kids go crazy about Wii, PSP and Nintendo.
6	We always try to play a little more by finishing our home works faster by cleaning up our bedroom, whatever it takes in order to pass the level, or to beat our previous scores.
7	One day I thought: What if instead of just playing, I could create my own screens, heroes and bad guys, punches, pirouettes and extra lives?
8	Unattainable?
9	No, no.
10	A child my age can do it!
11	While new technologies are everywhere, and grownups use them for their stuff, such as computers in the cars — although my parents still get lost — cell phones, checking up emails, shopping, going through the internet; children use them to play.
12	Because we are children, and that's what we like the most.
13	We all know that for us children, it is second nature to handle those tech devices that many adults — Maybe because we're not afraid to touch, to try things out and see what is in there, or even break them, because parents can later fix everything up.
14	(Laughter) This childlike curiosity helped me create my own games.
15	I realized that I could learn by playing and play while learning.
16	I could experiment, create, share, understand and reason how things are made, and then use that with everything else I was learning.
17	Turns out that all that learning is what adults call Creative Computing.
18	I was once told that programming is like a play.
19	We have a scenario with our actors who will interact upon our instructions.
20	We can disguise them to create animations or add up images, sounds, etc.
21	You probably think: this sounds good, but a little kid, alone in his room, programming — Not exactly social.
22	Well, there is more to it than that.
23	It's an open, public community worldwide, where we can belong and where we can publish our programs, or download programs and play with them, see how they were made, modify or improve them.
24	Nowadays, this community shares more than 10,000 programs, in a community of children, grownups, and professors of colleges, institutes and universities.
25	As I became more and more passionate, I made new friends with whom I shared creations, then I thought that if I taught my schoolmates they could also enjoy as much as I.
26	Besides, programming helps me learn in a very fun way what we were learning at school.
27	It was an aha moment.
28	Last year, when we were learning about human bones in class I came up with a Q&A game, this is it: (Video) I'll show you the game I created to learn the human skeleton bones for a class I had last year.
29	In this game the human body asks you where the bones are.
30	I'll click the green check I'll display it full screen, and it asks you where the jaw is?
31	you have to answer with the right number if it is 10, 11, 1, 2 or 3.
32	"I answer 10 which is the right one and it says ""Correeeect!"""
33	"but if your answer is wrong it says: ""Wah, wah, wah""."
34	I recorded and added every sound to the game, I added right and wrong answers.
35	The program scores right and deducts wrong answers so I can now play and compete with my friends, to see who knows the human bones better.
36	(Applauses) I had so much fun programming the game and it became so helpful for my learning, that I asked my teacher if we could use it in class.
37	I wanted to show everybody, and so I did.
38	We picked a day for me to show my classmates all those projects, I showed them how they were as capable as me to do the same.
39	Of course, they loved it.
40	"Children and teachers liked it so much, that this year we founded The Programming Club ""El páramo de Villanubla"" a group of 26 children, so far, who enjoy programming individually or as a team."
41	Now I am working on a game about space (Video) I am going to show you the game I created with the video sensor, about planets and the solar system.
42	You have to head punch the planets so they don't fall into the sea.
43	I switch to full screen I added right and wrong answers, and here is the sea.
44	The planets start to fall, You aim the camera towards you so it follows your head movements to head punch the planets on the screen, if you hit them, you hear the name and the planet shape switches into a label on the screen.
45	and it scores points for every head punch.
46	But if you fail to punch the planet, you hear them fall into the sea and a point gets deducted from the score.
47	Well, I think you get the idea.
48	(Applause) Isn't it cool?
49	And knowing that I did it, makes it better!
50	Besides I'm going to show it to the 5-year-old kids at school who are learning about the solar system, and I bet this game will help them learn better.
51	This makes me even happier, knowing that my games are not just fun, but useful.
52	Yet, it's not the first time I program something for the little kids at school.
53	Since my parents noticed that I liked it and I was doing well at school, when I turned 7, I got a present.
54	When I first saw it, I was like, What is this, some cables?
55	"And they told me: ""With this you'll do magic."""
56	They were right, I'm going to show you.
57	It was a Makey Makey board.
58	By connecting it to a computer, you can plug cables to anything as original as gummies, play dough, fruit, pencils, water or just by touching them, make programs and games work as if it is magic.
59	I told this to Marga, the teacher of the 4 year olds at my school and she asked me if we could do a special project about music and orchestra instruments.
60	Both teachers and students would make instruments with cardboard and foamy.
61	meanwhile, I had to build the necessary programs so that the instruments would come to life and sound real.
62	So I told this to Juanje, a friend of mine, and we both started working.
63	For us this was an interesting project but it was challenging: because little kids were supposed to listen to us, and we are children too!
64	When everything was set, we gather all the kids and showed them the sound of their instruments.
65	We even taught them that they too had music within.
66	It was mind blowing!
67	Little kids were great.
68	We organized groups so everyone could play their instruments.
69	We were truly seen as magicians who had used some cables and a computer to impress both adults and kids.
70	Well, do you want to se how we did it?
71	I'm going to show you I brought some of those instruments.
72	By the way, I want to thank my school for letting me show you a bit of that magic, something any kid can do just with a little of imagination, cables and a computer To play this super piano made by four year olds, I have to remove my shoes.
73	My feet are clean, eh!
74	(Laughter) Let's see if you know this song.
75	(Music) (Applause) Now I'm going to show you how water makes more sounds than those made when it comes out of the faucet.
76	This song is dedicated to my grandma because next week is her birthday (Laughter) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) I will now need four volunteers.
77	Here and now we are going to hear their sound.
78	Let's see, the four guys over there.
79	(Laughter) (Applause) Pick this one.
80	You pick that one.
81	Let's hear what instrument you sound like.
82	(Noise) Wow!
83	you sound like a noise!
84	(Battery dish) You sound like battery dishes You have no sound.
85	(Laughter) (Drum roll) You sound like a drum.
86	And you, let's see what do you sound like.
87	(Neighing) Oh we have a horse!!
88	(Laughter) (Applause) I hope you enjoyed what I brought to you.
89	See how I was not fooling you?
90	You can imagine, create and share just with some cables, a bit of imagination and a computer.
91	Try it out kids!
92	Stop just being gamers, and become creators of stories, game programs and musical projects.
93	Our imagination is the limit.
94	But go beyond!
95	Show it to the world, upload it to the web for others to see, and more people can play, but knowing that we as kids, can decide too how we want things done.
96	And I ask all the parents that please help us put together programming workshops at schools so every kid can learn this.
97	It is important for your kids.
98	(Applause) Never forget that nothing is impossible, It's all up to our effort and desire of self-improvement, even if we are young, we have a lot to teach in return.
99	Thank you so much for your attention, see you soon.
100	(Applause)
0	Ever since computers were invented, we've been trying to make them smarter and more powerful.
1	From the abacus, to room-sized machines, to desktops, to computers in our pockets.
2	And are now designing artificial intelligence to automate tasks that would require human intelligence.
3	If you look at the history of computing, we've always treated computers as external devices that compute and act on our behalf.
4	What I want to do is I want to weave computing, AI and internet as part of us.
5	As part of human cognition, freeing us to interact with the world around us.
6	Integrate human and machine intelligence right inside our own bodies to augment us, instead of diminishing us or replacing us.
7	Could we combine what people do best, such as creative and intuitive thinking, with what computers do best, such as processing information and perfectly memorizing stuff?
8	Could this whole be better than the sum of its parts?
9	We have a device that could make that possible.
10	It's called AlterEgo, and it's a wearable device that gives you the experience of a conversational AI that lives inside your head, that you could talk to in likeness to talking to yourself internally.
11	We have a new prototype that we're showing here, for the first time at TED, and here's how it works.
12	Normally, when we speak, the brain sends neurosignals through the nerves to your internal speech systems, to activate them and your vocal cords to produce speech.
13	One of the most complex cognitive and motor tasks that we do as human beings.
14	Now, imagine talking to yourself without vocalizing, without moving your mouth, without moving your jaw, but by simply articulating those words internally.
15	Thereby very subtly engaging your internal speech systems, such as your tongue and back of your palate.
16	When that happens, the brain sends extremely weak signals to these internal speech systems.
17	AlterEgo has sensors, embedded in a thin plastic, flexible and transparent device that sits on your neck just like a sticker.
18	These sensors pick up on these internal signals sourced deep within the mouth cavity, right from the surface of the skin.
19	An AI program running in the background then tries to figure out what the user's trying to say.
20	It then feeds back an answer to the user by means of bone conduction, audio conducted through the skull into the user's inner ear, that the user hears, overlaid on top of the user's natural hearing of the environment, without blocking it.
21	The combination of all these parts, the input, the output and the AI, gives a net subjective experience of an interface inside your head that you could talk to in likeness to talking to yourself.
22	Just to be very clear, the device does not record or read your thoughts.
23	It records deliberate information that you want to communicate through deliberate engagement of your internal speech systems.
24	People don't want to be read, they want to write.
25	Which is why we designed the system to deliberately record from the peripheral nervous system.
26	Which is why the control in all situations resides with the user.
27	I want to stop here for a second and show you a live demo.
28	What I'm going to do is, I'm going to ask Eric a question.
29	And he's going to search for that information without vocalizing, without typing, without moving his fingers, without moving his mouth.
30	Simply by internally asking that question.
31	The AI will then figure out the answer and feed it back to Eric, through audio, through the device.
32	While you see a laptop in front of him, he's not using it.
33	Everything lives on the device.
34	All he needs is that sticker device to interface with the AI and the internet.
35	So, Eric, what's the weather in Vancouver like, right now?
36	What you see on the screen are the words that Eric is speaking to himself right now.
37	This is happening in real time.
38	Eric: It's 50 degrees and rainy here in Vancouver.
39	Arnav Kapur: What happened is that the AI sent the answer through audio, through the device, back to Eric.
40	What could the implications of something like this be?
41	Imagine perfectly memorizing things, where you perfectly record information that you silently speak, and then hear them later when you want to, internally searching for information, crunching numbers at speeds computers do, silently texting other people.
42	Suddenly becoming multilingual, so that you internally speak in one language, and hear the translation in your head in another.
43	The potential could be far-reaching.
44	There are millions of people around the world who struggle with using natural speech.
45	People with conditions such as ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, stroke and oral cancer, amongst many other conditions.
46	For them, communicating is a painstakingly slow and tiring process.
47	This is Doug.
48	Doug was diagnosed with ALS about 12 years ago and has since lost the ability to speak.
49	Today, he uses an on-screen keyboard where he types in individual letters using his head movements.
50	And it takes several minutes to communicate a single sentence.
51	So we went to Doug and asked him what were the first words he'd like to use or say, using our system.
52	"Perhaps a greeting, like, ""Hello, how are you?"""
53	Or indicate that he needed help with something.
54	What Doug said that he wanted to use our system for is to reboot the old system he had, because that old system kept on crashing.
55	(Laughter)
56	We never could have predicted that.
57	I'm going to show you a short clip of Doug using our system for the first time.
58	(Voice) Reboot computer.
59	AK: What you just saw there was Doug communicating or speaking in real time for the first time since he lost the ability to speak.
60	There are millions of people who might be able to communicate in real time like Doug, with other people, with their friends and with their families.
61	My hope is to be able to help them express their thoughts and ideas.
62	I believe computing, AI and the internet would disappear into us as extensions of our cognition, instead of being external entities or adversaries, amplifying human ingenuity, giving us unimaginable abilities and unlocking our true potential.
63	And perhaps even freeing us to becoming better at being human.
64	Thank you so much.
65	(Applause)
66	Shoham Arad: Come over here.
67	OK.
68	I want to ask you a couple of questions, they're going to clear the stage.
69	I feel like this is amazing, it's innovative, it's creepy, it's terrifying.
70	Can you tell us what I think ...
71	I think there are some uncomfortable feelings around this.
72	Tell us, is this reading your thoughts, will it in five years, is there a weaponized version of this, what does it look like?
73	AK: So our first design principle, before we started working on this, was to not render ethics as an afterthought.
74	So we wanted to bake ethics right into the design.
75	We flipped the design.
76	Instead of reading from the brain directly, we're reading from the voluntary nervous system that you deliberately have to engage to communicate with the device, while still bringing the benefits of a thinking or a thought device.
77	The best of both worlds in a way.
78	SA: OK, I think people are going to have a lot more questions for you.
79	Also, you said that it's a sticker.
80	So right now it sits just right here?
81	Is that the final iteration, what the final design you hope looks like?
82	AK: Our goal is for the technology to disappear completely.
83	SA: What does that mean?
84	AK: If you're wearing it, I shouldn't be able to see it.
85	You don't want technology on your face, you want it in the background, to augment you in the background.
86	So we have a sticker version that conforms to the skin, that looks like the skin, but we're trying to make an even smaller version that would sit right here.
87	SA: OK.
88	I feel like if anyone has any questions they want to ask Arnav, he'll be here all week.
89	OK, thank you so much, Arnav.
90	AK: Thanks, Shoham.
0	For 3 billion people around the world, seafood provides a significant source of protein and nutrition.
1	But recent studies show that 33% of wild fisheries are overfished, while another 60% are fished at their maximum capacity.
2	In fact, over half the seafood we eat– from finfish and shellfish to seaweed and algae– isn’t caught in the wild.
3	It’s grown through aquaculture, or aquatic farming.
4	Farmed seafood is one of the fastest-growing food industries, expanding in volume by 5.8% each year.
5	But different methods of aquaculture come with different advantages and issues– some of which echo the serious problems we’ve seen in industrial agriculture.
6	So how can we avoid repeating the mistakes we’ve made on land, at sea?
7	What aquaculture approaches are we currently using, and what does a sustainable way to farm the ocean really look like?
8	One of the most common aquaculture methods involves large pens made of nets, where fish are farmed offshore in floating cages roughly 1000 square meters in size.
9	Commonly employed off the coast of Chile and in the fjords of Norway, these fish, like many industrially farmed animals, occupy stressful, overcrowded pens.
10	They produce massive amounts of waste, polluting the surrounding areas and potentially spreading diseases to wild species.
11	Worse still, since the antibiotics employed to fight disease aren’t fully absorbed by the fish, they get excreted back into the environment.
12	Net pens are also susceptible to escapes, unleashing huge numbers of fish which compete for resources and weaken the local gene pool with genes adapted for captivity.
13	Escaped fish can even disrupt local ecosystems as invasive species.
14	Other techniques, such as man-made coastal ponds commonly used for shrimp farming in Southeast Asia, create additional environmental problems.
15	Just like net pens, these ponds are prone to spreading pollution and disease.
16	Their construction also frequently destroys important ecosystems like mangroves and marshes, which protect coastal areas from storms, provide habitats, and absorb tons of greenhouse gases.
17	One way to solve these problems is to farm fish on land in completely contained systems.
18	Tanks and raceways can recirculate and filter water to prevent pollution.
19	But even fully contained facilities still contend with another major hurdle: fishmeal.
20	About 10% of the seafood caught globally is used to feed animals, including carnivorous farmed fish.
21	Researchers are working on fish feed made of insects and plant-based proteins, but for now many inland fish farms are connected to overfishing.
22	All these obstacles can make sustainable aquaculture feel a long way off, but innovative farmers are finding new ways to responsibly farm the seas.
23	The most promising solution of all may be to look lower on the food chain.
24	Instead of cramming large, carnivorous fish into pens, we can work with natural ocean systems to produce huge amounts of shellfish and seaweeds.
25	These low-maintenance flora and fauna don’t need to be fed at all.
26	In fact, they naturally improve water quality, filtering it as they feed off of sunlight and nutrients in the seawater.
27	By absorbing carbon through photosynthesis, these farms help battle climate change, and reduce local ocean acidification while creating habitats for other species to thrive.
28	Shifting to restorative ocean farming could provide good jobs for coastal communities, and support healthy plant and shellfish-based diets that have an incredibly low carbon footprint.
29	In just 5 months, 4,000 square meters of ocean can produce 25 tons of seaweed and 250,000 of shellfish.
30	With the right distribution network, a series of small farms, collectively the size of Washington State could feed the planet.
31	Farms like these are already popping up around the globe, and a new generation of farmers is stepping up to pursue a more sustainable future.
32	Done properly, regenerative ocean farming could play a vital role in helping our oceans, our climate, and ourselves.
0	I'd like to introduce you to an interesting person named Ötzi.
1	He lives in Italy at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology because he's a mummy.
2	This is an artist's rendition of what he might have looked like when he was alive 5,300 years ago.
3	You want to see what he looks like today?
4	(Laughter)
5	OK, brace yourselves, gross mummy pic coming at you.
6	So, he's not as handsome as he used to be, but he's actually in great shape for a mummy because he was discovered frozen in ice.
7	Ötzi is the oldest mummy that's been discovered with preserved skin.
8	5,300 years is super old, older than the Egyptian pyramids, and Ötzi's skin is covered in 61 black tattoos, all lines and crosses on parts of his body where he might have experienced pain.
9	So scientists think that they might have been used to mark sites for some kind of therapy, like acupuncture.
10	So clearly, if the oldest skin we've seen is all tattooed up, tattooing is a very ancient practice.
11	But fast-forward to today and tattoos are everywhere.
12	Almost one in four Americans has a tattoo, it's a multibillion-dollar industry, and whether you love tattoos or hate them, this talk will change the way you think about them.
13	So, why are tattoos so popular?
14	Unlike Ötzi, most of us today use tattoos for some kind of self-expression.
15	Personally, I love tattoos because I love art and there is something so wonderful to me, almost romantic, about the way a tattoo as an art form cannot be commodified.
16	Right?
17	Your tattoo lives and dies with you.
18	It can't be bought or sold or traded, so its only value is really personal to you, and I love that.
19	Now, I tend to gravitate towards really colorful tattoos because I'm obsessed with color.
20	I teach a whole course on it at my university.
21	But my very first tattoo was an all-black tattoo like Ötzi's.
22	Yep, I did that clichéd thing that young people do sometimes and I got a tattoo in a language I can't even read.
23	(Laughter)
24	"OK, but I was 19 years old, I had just returned from my first trip overseas, I was in Japan in the mountains meditating in Buddhist monasteries, and it was a really meaningful experience to me, so I wanted to commemorate it with this Japanese and Chinese character for ""mountain."""
25	Now, here's what blows my mind.
26	My 14-year-old tattoo and Ötzi's 5,300-year-old tattoos are made of the same exact stuff: soot, that black powdery carbon dust that gets left behind in the fireplace when you burn stuff.
27	And if you zoom way, way in on either my tattoo or Ötzi's tattoos, you'll find that they all look something like this.
28	A tattoo is nothing more than a bunch of tiny pigment particles, soot in this case, that get trapped in the dermis, which is the layer of tissue right underneath the surface of the skin.
29	So in over five thousand years, we've done very little to update tattoo technology, apart from getting access to more colors and slightly more efficient methods of installation.
30	While I'm an artist, I'm also a scientist, and I direct a laboratory that researches nanotechnology, which is the science of building things with ultratiny building blocks, thousands of times smaller even than the width of a human hair.
31	And I began to ask myself, how could nanotechnology serve tattooing?
32	If tattoos are just a bunch of particles in the skin, could we swap those particles out for ones that do something more interesting?
33	Here's my big idea: I believe that tattoos can give you superpowers.
34	(Laughter)
35	Now, I don't mean they're going to make us fly, but I do think that we can have superpowers in the sense that tattoos can give us new abilities that we don't currently possess.
36	By upgrading the particles, we can engineer tattooing so that it will change not only the appearance of our skin, but also the function of our skin.
37	Let me show you.
38	This is a diagram of a microcapsule.
39	It's a tiny hollow particle with a protective outer shell, about the size of a tattoo pigment, and you can fill the inside with practically whatever you want.
40	So what if we put interesting materials inside of these microcapsules and made tattoo inks with them?
41	What sorts of things could we make a tattoo do?
42	What problems could we solve?
43	What human limitations could we overcome?
44	Well, here's one idea: one of our weaknesses as humans is that we can't see ultraviolet, or UV, light.
45	That's the high-energy part of sunlight that causes sunburn and increases our risk of skin cancer.
46	Many animals and insects can actually see UV light, but we can't.
47	If we could, we'd be able to see sunscreen when it was applied on our skin.
48	Unfortunately, most of us don't wear sunscreen, and those of us who do can't really tell when it wears off, because it's invisible.
49	It's the main reason we treat over five million cases of preventable skin cancer every year in the US alone, costing our economy over five billion dollars annually.
50	So how could we overcome this human weakness with a tattoo?
51	Well, if the problem is that we can't see UV rays, maybe we can make a tattoo detect them for us.
52	So I thought, why don't we take some microcapsules, load it up with a UV-sensitive, color-changing dye, and make a tattoo ink out of that?
53	Now, one of the troubles of being a tattoo technologist is finding willing test subjects.
54	(Laughter)
55	And when it came time to test this tattoo ink, I thought it best not to torture my poor graduate students.
56	So I decided to tattoo a couple of spots on my own arm instead.
57	And It actually worked.
58	Check it out!
59	I call these tattoos solar freckles because they're powered by sunshine.
60	And right now, they're invisible, but as soon as I expose them to a UV light, acting as the Sun — there they are, blue spots.
61	Now, I'm not wearing sunscreen in this video, but if I was, those blue spots would not appear, and then when my sunscreen wore off later, the solar freckles would reappear in UV light and I would know that it was time to reapply sunscreen.
62	So these tattoos act as a real-time, naked-eye indicator of your skin's UV exposure.
63	And of course, I think there are lots of really cool, artistic things you could do with a color-changing tattoo like this, but I hope that it will also help us solve a big problem in skin protection.
64	(Applause)
65	Let me give you another example.
66	Normal human body temperature is about 97 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit, and if you fall outside of that range, you need to seek medical attention right away.
67	Now, the problem is that humans can't detect our own body temperature without a thermometer.
68	Sure, you could try the old hand-on-the-forehead trick, but there's zero scientific evidence to back that up.
69	(Laughter)
70	So what if we could create a tattooable thermometer that you could access anytime?
71	Well, remember how the solar freckles used a UV-sensitive dye inside of the microcapsules of the tattoo ink?
72	Well, you could also put heat-sensitive dyes inside of microcapsules and you could make different tattoo inks that change color at different temperatures.
73	Suppose it was 96, 98, and a hundred degrees Fahrenheit.
74	If you place those inks side by side, now you have a temperature scale tuned to the human body.
75	In this video, you can see the different patches of tattoos disappearing sequentially as the pigskin we tested them on is heated up.
76	So if you were to place a tattoo like this in a location that was stable to external temperature fluctuations — maybe inside of the mouth, perhaps on the back of the lip?
77	— then you'd be able to read your body temperature anytime by just glancing at your tattoo in the mirror.
78	Amazing, right?
79	(Applause)
80	Thank you.
81	(Applause)
82	Another limitation that we have as humans is that our skin doesn't conduct electricity, and that can be a good thing, but not necessarily —
83	(Laughter)
84	if you have an electronic biomedical implant, like a pacemaker for example.
85	Right now, if you have a pacemaker, you need surgery every five or 10 years to replace the battery when it dies.
86	And wouldn't it be nice if, instead, we could simply recharge the battery through a patch of conducting skin?
87	Well, if you were to try to tackle that problem with a tattoo, the first step would be to make a tattoo that conducts electricity.
88	So we've been working on a conducting tattoo ink in my lab.
89	And right now, we're able to increase the conductivity of skin over 300-fold with our conducting tattoo ink.
90	Now, we have a long way to go before we reach the conductivity of something like a copper wire, but we're making progress and I'm really excited about this because I think that it could open up a whole new world of possibility for tattoos.
91	I envision a future where tattoos enable us — tattooable wires and tattooable electronics enable us to merge our technologies with our bodies so that they feel more like extensions of ourselves rather than external devices.
92	So these are a few examples of the new abilities that we can gain by using nanotechnology to upgrade our tattoos, but this really is only the beginning.
93	I believe the sky is the limit for what we can do with high-tech tattoos.
94	In the future, tattoos will not only be beautiful, they'll be functional too.
95	Thank you.
96	(Applause)
0	Is it just me, or are there other people here that are a little bit disappointed with democracy?
1	(Applause)
2	So let's look at a few numbers.
3	If we look across the world, the median turnout in presidential elections over the last 30 years has been just 67 percent.
4	Now, if we go to Europe and we look at people that participated in EU parliamentary elections, the median turnout in those elections is just 42 percent.
5	Now let's go to New York, and let's see how many people voted in the last election for mayor.
6	We will find that only 24 percent of people showed up to vote.
7	"What that means is that, if ""Friends"" was still running, Joey and maybe Phoebe would have shown up to vote."
8	(Laughter)
9	And you cannot blame them because people are tired of politicians.
10	And people are tired of other people using the data that they have generated to communicate with their friends and family, to target political propaganda at them.
11	But the thing about this is that this is not new.
12	Nowadays, people use likes to target propaganda at you before they use your zip code or your gender or your age, because the idea of targeting people with propaganda for political purposes is as old as politics.
13	And the reason why that idea is there is because democracy has a basic vulnerability.
14	This is the idea of a representative.
15	In principle, democracy is the ability of people to exert power.
16	But in practice, we have to delegate that power to a representative that can exert that power for us.
17	That representative is a bottleneck, or a weak spot.
18	It is the place that you want to target if you want to attack democracy because you can capture democracy by either capturing that representative or capturing the way that people choose it.
19	So the big question is: Is this the end of history?
20	Is this the best that we can do or, actually, are there alternatives?
21	Some people have been thinking about alternatives, and one of the ideas that is out there is the idea of direct democracy.
22	This is the idea of bypassing politicians completely and having people vote directly on issues, having people vote directly on bills.
23	But this idea is naive because there's too many things that we would need to choose.
24	If you look at the 114th US Congress, you will have seen that the House of Representatives considered more than 6,000 bills, the Senate considered more than 3,000 bills and they approved more than 300 laws.
25	Those would be many decisions that each person would have to make a week on topics that they know little about.
26	So there's a big cognitive bandwidth problem if we're going to try to think about direct democracy as a viable alternative.
27	So some people think about the idea of liquid democracy, or fluid democracy, which is the idea that you endorse your political power to someone, who can endorse it to someone else, and, eventually, you create a large follower network in which, at the end, there's a few people that are making decisions on behalf of all of their followers and their followers.
28	But this idea also doesn't solve the problem of the cognitive bandwidth and, to be honest, it's also quite similar to the idea of having a representative.
29	So what I'm going to do today is I'm going to be a little bit provocative, and I'm going to ask you, well: What if, instead of trying to bypass politicians, we tried to automate them?
30	The idea of automation is not new.
31	It was started more than 300 years ago, when French weavers decided to automate the loom.
32	The winner of that industrial war was Joseph-Marie Jacquard.
33	He was a French weaver and merchant that married the loom with the steam engine to create autonomous looms.
34	And in those autonomous looms, he gained control.
35	He could now make fabrics that were more complex and more sophisticated than the ones they were able to do by hand.
36	But also, by winning that industrial war, he laid out what has become the blueprint of automation.
37	The way that we automate things for the last 300 years has always been the same: we first identify a need, then we create a tool to satisfy that need, like the loom, in this case, and then we study how people use that tool to automate that user.
38	That's how we came from the mechanical loom to the autonomous loom, and that took us a thousand years.
39	Now, it's taken us only a hundred years to use the same script to automate the car.
40	But the thing is that, this time around, automation is kind of for real.
41	This is a video that a colleague of mine from Toshiba shared with me that shows the factory that manufactures solid state drives.
42	The entire factory is a robot.
43	There are no humans in that factory.
44	And the robots are soon to leave the factories and become part of our world, become part of our workforce.
45	So what I do in my day job is actually create tools that integrate data for entire countries so that we can ultimately have the foundations that we need for a future in which we need to also manage those machines.
46	But today, I'm not here to talk to you about these tools that integrate data for countries.
47	But I'm here to talk to you about another idea that might help us think about how to use artificial intelligence in democracy.
48	Because the tools that I build are designed for executive decisions.
49	These are decisions that can be cast in some sort of term of objectivity — public investment decisions.
50	But there are decisions that are legislative, and these decisions that are legislative require communication among people that have different points of view, require participation, require debate, require deliberation.
51	And for a long time, we have thought that, well, what we need to improve democracy is actually more communication.
52	So all of the technologies that we have advanced in the context of democracy, whether they are newspapers or whether it is social media, have tried to provide us with more communication.
53	But we've been down that rabbit hole, and we know that's not what's going to solve the problem.
54	Because it's not a communication problem, it's a cognitive bandwidth problem.
55	So if the problem is one of cognitive bandwidth, well, adding more communication to people is not going to be what's going to solve it.
56	What we are going to need instead is to have other technologies that help us deal with some of the communication that we are overloaded with.
57	Think of, like, a little avatar, a software agent, a digital Jiminy Cricket —
58	(Laughter)
59	that basically is able to answer things on your behalf.
60	And if we had that technology, we would be able to offload some of the communication and help, maybe, make better decisions or decisions at a larger scale.
61	And the thing is that the idea of software agents is also not new.
62	We already use them all the time.
63	We use software agents to choose the way that we're going to drive to a certain location, the music that we're going to listen to or to get suggestions for the next books that we should read.
64	So there is an obvious idea in the 21st century that was as obvious as the idea of putting together a steam engine with a loom at the time of Jacquard.
65	And that idea is combining direct democracy with software agents.
66	Imagine, for a second, a world in which, instead of having a representative that represents you and millions of other people, you can have a representative that represents only you, with your nuanced political views — that weird combination of libertarian and liberal and maybe a little bit conservative on some issues and maybe very progressive on others.
67	Politicians nowadays are packages, and they're full of compromises.
68	But you might have someone that can represent only you, if you are willing to give up the idea that that representative is a human.
69	If that representative is a software agent, we could have a senate that has as many senators as we have citizens.
70	And those senators are going to be able to read every bill and they're going to be able to vote on each one of them.
71	So there's an obvious idea that maybe we want to consider.
72	But I understand that in this day and age, this idea might be quite scary.
73	In fact, thinking of a robot coming from the future to help us run our governments sounds terrifying.
74	But we've been there before.
75	(Laughter)
76	And actually he was quite a nice guy.
77	So what would the Jacquard loom version of this idea look like?
78	It would be a very simple system.
79	Imagine a system that you log in and you create your avatar, and then you're going to start training your avatar.
80	So you can provide your avatar with your reading habits, or connect it to your social media, or you can connect it to other data, for example by taking psychological tests.
81	And the nice thing about this is that there's no deception.
82	You are not providing data to communicate with your friends and family that then gets used in a political system.
83	You are providing data to a system that is designed to be used to make political decisions on your behalf.
84	Then you take that data and you choose a training algorithm, because it's an open marketplace in which different people can submit different algorithms to predict how you're going to vote, based on the data you have provided.
85	And the system is open, so nobody controls the algorithms; there are algorithms that become more popular and others that become less popular.
86	Eventually, you can audit the system.
87	You can see how your avatar is working.
88	If you like it, you can leave it on autopilot.
89	If you want to be a little more controlling, you can actually choose that they ask you every time they're going to make a decision, or you can be anywhere in between.
90	One of the reasons why we use democracy so little may be because democracy has a very bad user interface.
91	And if we improve the user interface of democracy, we might be able to use it more.
92	Of course, there's a lot of questions that you might have.
93	Well, how do you train these avatars?
94	How do you keep the data secure?
95	How do you keep the systems distributed and auditable?
96	How about my grandmother, who's 80 years old and doesn't know how to use the internet?
97	Trust me, I've heard them all.
98	So when you think about an idea like this, you have to beware of pessimists because they are known to have a problem for every solution.
99	(Laughter)
100	So I want to invite you to think about the bigger ideas.
101	The questions I just showed you are little ideas because they are questions about how this would not work.
102	The big ideas are ideas of: What else can you do with this if this would happen to work?
103	And one of those ideas is, well, who writes the laws?
104	In the beginning, we could have the avatars that we already have, voting on laws that are written by the senators or politicians that we already have.
105	But if this were to work, you could write an algorithm that could try to write a law that would get a certain percentage of approval, and you could reverse the process.
106	Now, you might think that this idea is ludicrous and we should not do it, but you cannot deny that it's an idea that is only possible in a world in which direct democracy and software agents are a viable form of participation.
107	So how do we start the revolution?
108	We don't start this revolution with picket fences or protests or by demanding our current politicians to be changed into robots.
109	That's not going to work.
110	This is much more simple, much slower and much more humble.
111	We start this revolution by creating simple systems like this in grad schools, in libraries, in nonprofits.
112	And we try to figure out all of those little questions and those little problems that we're going to have to figure out to make this idea something viable, to make this idea something that we can trust.
113	And as we create those systems that have a hundred people, a thousand people, a hundred thousand people voting in ways that are not politically binding, we're going to develop trust in this idea, the world is going to change, and those that are as little as my daughter is right now are going to grow up.
114	And by the time my daughter is my age, maybe this idea, that I know today is very crazy, might not be crazy to her and to her friends.
115	And at that point, we will be at the end of our history, but they will be at the beginning of theirs.
116	Thank you.
117	(Applause)
0	The contents of this metal cylinder could either revolutionize technology or be completely useless— it all depends on whether we can harness the strange physics of matter at very, very small scales.
1	To have even a chance of doing so, we have to control the environment precisely: the thick tabletop and legs guard against vibrations from footsteps, nearby elevators, and opening or closing doors.
2	The cylinder is a vacuum chamber, devoid of all the gases in air.
3	Inside the vacuum chamber is a smaller, extremely cold compartment, reachable by tiny laser beams.
4	Inside are ultra-sensitive particles that make up a quantum computer.
5	So what makes these particles worth the effort?
6	In theory, quantum computers could outstrip the computational limits of classical computers.
7	Classical computers process data in the form of bits.
8	Each bit can switch between two states labeled zero and one.
9	A quantum computer uses something called a qubit, which can switch between zero, one, and what’s called a superposition.
10	While the qubit is in its superposition, it has a lot more information than one or zero.
11	You can think of these positions as points on a sphere: the north and south poles of the sphere represent one and zero.
12	A bit can only switch between these two poles, but when a qubit is in its superposition, it can be at any point on the sphere.
13	We can’t locate it exactly— the moment we read it, the qubit resolves into a zero or a one.
14	But even though we can’t observe the qubit in its superposition, we can manipulate it to perform particular operations while in this state.
15	So as a problem grows more complicated, a classical computer needs correspondingly more bits to solve it, while a quantum computer will theoretically be able to handle more and more complicated problems without requiring as many more qubits as a classical computer would need bits.
16	The unique properties of quantum computers result from the behavior of atomic and subatomic particles.
17	These particles have quantum states, which correspond to the state of the qubit.
18	Quantum states are incredibly fragile, easily destroyed by temperature and pressure fluctuations, stray electromagnetic fields, and collisions with nearby particles.
19	That’s why quantum computers need such an elaborate set up.
20	It’s also why, for now, the power of quantum computers remains largely theoretical.
21	So far, we can only control a few qubits in the same place at the same time.
22	There are two key components involved in managing these fickle quantum states effectively: the types of particles a quantum computer uses, and how it manipulates those particles.
23	For now, there are two leading approaches: trapped ions and superconducting qubits.
24	A trapped ion quantum computer uses ions as its particles and manipulates them with lasers.
25	The ions are housed in a trap made of electrical fields.
26	Inputs from the lasers tell the ions what operation to make by causing the qubit state to rotate on the sphere.
27	To use a simplified example, the lasers could input the question: what are the prime factors of 15?
28	In response, the ions may release photons— the state of the qubit determines whether the ion emits photons and how many photons it emits.
29	An imaging system collects these photons and processes them to reveal the answer: 3 and 5.
30	Superconducting qubit quantum computers do the same thing in a different way: using a chip with electrical circuits instead of an ion trap.
31	The states of each electrical circuit translate to the state of the qubit.
32	They can be manipulated with electrical inputs in the form of microwaves.
33	So: the qubits come from either ions or electrical circuits, acted on by either lasers or microwaves.
34	Each approach has advantages and disadvantages.
35	Ions can be manipulated very precisely, and they last a long time, but as more ions are added to a trap, it becomes increasingly difficult to control each with precision.
36	We can’t currently contain enough ions in a trap to make advanced computations, but one possible solution might be to connect many smaller traps that communicate with each other via photons rather than trying to create one big trap.
37	Superconducting circuits, meanwhile, make operations much faster than trapped ions, and it’s easier to scale up the number of circuits in a computer than the number of ions.
38	But the circuits are also more fragile, and have a shorter overall lifespan.
39	And as quantum computers advance, they will still be subject to the environmental constraints needed to preserve quantum states.
40	But in spite of all these obstacles, we’ve already succeeded at making computations in a realm we can’t enter or even observe.
0	In 2015, 25 teams from around the world competed to build robots for disaster response that could perform a number of tasks, such as using a power tool, working on uneven terrain and driving a car.
1	That all sounds impressive, and it is, but look at the body of the winning robot, HUBO.
2	Here, HUBO is trying to get out of a car, and keep in mind, the video is sped up three times.
3	(Laughter)
4	HUBO, from team KAIST out of Korea, is a state-of-the-art robot with impressive capabilities, but this body doesn't look all that different from robots we've seen a few decades ago.
5	If you look at the other robots in the competition, their movements also still look, well, very robotic.
6	Their bodies are complex mechanical structures using rigid materials such as metal and traditional rigid electric motors.
7	They certainly weren't designed to be low-cost, safe near people and adaptable to unpredictable challenges.
8	We've made good progress with the brains of robots, but their bodies are still primitive.
9	This is my daughter Nadia.
10	She's only five years old and she can get out of the car way faster than HUBO.
11	(Laughter)
12	She can also swing around on monkey bars with ease, much better than any current human-like robot could do.
13	In contrast to HUBO, the human body makes extensive use of soft and deformable materials such as muscle and skin.
14	We need a new generation of robot bodies that is inspired by the elegance, efficiency and by the soft materials of the designs found in nature.
15	And indeed, this has become the key idea of a new field of research called soft robotics.
16	My research group and collaborators around the world are using soft components inspired by muscle and skin to build robots with agility and dexterity that comes closer and closer to the astonishing capabilities of the organisms found in nature.
17	I've always been particularly inspired by biological muscle.
18	Now, that's not surprising.
19	I'm also Austrian, and I know that I sound a bit like Arnie, the Terminator.
20	(Laughter)
21	Biological muscle is a true masterpiece of evolution.
22	It can heal after damage and it's tightly integrated with sensory neurons for feedback on motion and the environment.
23	It can contract fast enough to power the high-speed wings of a hummingbird; it can grow strong enough to move an elephant; and it's adaptable enough to be used in the extremely versatile arms of an octopus, an animal that can squeeze its entire body through tiny holes.
24	Actuators are for robots what muscles are for animals: key components of the body that enable movement and interaction with the world.
25	So if we could build soft actuators, or artificial muscles, that are as versatile, adaptable and could have the same performance as the real thing, we could build almost any type of robot for almost any type of use.
26	Not surprisingly, people have tried for many decades to replicate the astonishing capabilities of muscle, but it's been really hard.
27	About 10 years ago, when I did my PhD back in Austria, my colleagues and I rediscovered what is likely one of the very first publications on artificial muscle, published in 1880.
28	"""On the shape and volume changes of dielectric bodies caused by electricity,"" published by German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen."
29	Most of you know him as the discoverer of the X-ray.
30	Following his instructions, we used a pair of needles.
31	We connected it to a high-voltage source, and we placed it near a transparent piece of rubber that was prestretched onto a plastic frame.
32	When we switched on the voltage, the rubber deformed, and just like our biceps flexes our arm, the rubber flexed the plastic frame.
33	It looks like magic.
34	The needles don't even touch the rubber.
35	Now, having two such needles is not a practical way of operating artificial muscles, but this amazing experiment got me hooked on the topic.
36	I wanted to create new ways to build artificial muscles that would work well for real-world applications.
37	For the next years, I worked on a number of different technologies that all showed promise, but they all had remaining challenges that are hard to overcome.
38	In 2015, when I started my own lab at CU Boulder, I wanted to try an entirely new idea.
39	I wanted to combine the high speed and efficiency of electrically driven actuators with the versatility of soft, fluidic actuators.
40	Therefore, I thought, maybe I can try using really old science in a new way.
41	The diagram you see here shows an effect called Maxwell stress.
42	When you take two metal plates and place them in a container filled with oil, and then switch on a voltage, the Maxwell stress forces the oil up in between the two plates, and that's what you see here.
43	So the key idea was, can we use this effect to push around oil contained in soft stretchy structures?
44	And indeed, this worked surprisingly well, quite honestly, much better than I expected.
45	Together with my outstanding team of students, we used this idea as a starting point to develop a new technology called HASEL artificial muscles.
46	HASELs are gentle enough to pick up a raspberry without damaging it.
47	They can expand and contract like real muscle.
48	And they can be operated faster than the real thing.
49	They can also be scaled up to deliver large forces.
50	Here you see them lifting a gallon filled with water.
51	They can be used to drive a robotic arm, and they can even self-sense their position.
52	HASELs can be used for very precise movement, but they can also deliver very fluidic, muscle-like movement and bursts of power to shoot up a ball into the air.
53	When submerged in oil, HASEL artificial muscles can be made invisible.
54	So how do HASEL artificial muscles work?
55	You might be surprised.
56	They're based on very inexpensive, easily available materials.
57	You can even try, and I recommend it, the main principle at home.
58	Take a few Ziploc bags and fill them with olive oil.
59	Try to push out air bubbles as much as you can.
60	Now take a glass plate and place it on one side of the bag.
61	When you press down, you see the bag contract.
62	Now the amount of contraction is easy to control.
63	When you take a small weight, you get a small contraction.
64	With a medium weight, we get a medium contraction.
65	And with a large weight, you get a large contraction.
66	Now for HASELs, the only change is to replace the force of your hand or the weight with an electrical force.
67	"HASEL stands for ""hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic actuators."""
68	Here you see a geometry called Peano-HASEL actuators, one of many possible designs.
69	Again, you take a flexible polymer such as our Ziploc bag, you fill it with an insulating liquid, such as olive oil, and now, instead of the glass plate, you place an electrical conductor on one side of the pouch.
70	To create something that looks more like a muscle fiber, you can connect a few pouches together and attached a weight on one side.
71	Next, we apply voltage.
72	Now, the electric field starts acting on the liquid.
73	It displaces the liquid, and it forces the muscle to contract.
74	Here you see a completed Peano-HASEL actuator and how it expands and contracts when voltage is applied.
75	Viewed from the side, you can really see those pouches take a more cylindrical shape, such as we saw with the Ziploc bags.
76	We can also place a few such muscle fibers next to each other to create something that looks even more like a muscle that also contracts and expands in cross section.
77	These HASELs here are lifting a weight that's about 200 times heavier than their own weight.
78	Here you see one of our newest designs, called quadrant donut HASELs and how they expand and contract.
79	They can be operated incredibly fast, reaching superhuman speeds.
80	They are even powerful enough to jump off the ground.
81	(Laughter)
82	Overall, HASELs show promise to become the first technology that matches or exceeds the performance of biological muscle while being compatible with large-scale manufacturing.
83	This is also a very young technology.
84	We are just getting started.
85	We have many ideas how to drastically improve performance, using new materials and new designs to reach a level of performance beyond biological muscle and also beyond traditional rigid electric motors.
86	Moving towards more complex designs of HASEL for bio-inspired robotics, here you see our artificial scorpion that can use its tail to hunt prey, in this case, a rubber balloon.
87	(Laughter)
88	Going back to our initial inspiration, the versatility of octopus arms and elephant trunks, we are now able to build soft continuum actuators that come closer and closer to the capabilities of the real thing.
89	I am most excited about the practical applications of HASEL artificial muscles.
90	They'll enable soft robotic devices that can improve the quality of life.
91	Soft robotics will enable a new generation of more lifelike prosthetics for people who have lost parts of their bodies.
92	Here you see some HASELs in my lab, early testing, driving a prosthetic finger.
93	One day, we may even merge our bodies with robotic parts.
94	I know that sounds very scary at first.
95	But when I think about my grandparents and the way they become more dependent on others to perform simple everyday tasks such as using the restroom alone, they often feel like they're becoming a burden.
96	With soft robotics, we will be able to enhance and restore agility and dexterity, and thereby help older people maintain autonomy for longer parts of their lives.
97	"Maybe we can call that ""robotics for antiaging"" or even a next stage of human evolution."
98	Unlike their traditional rigid counterparts, soft life-like robots will safely operate near people and help us at home.
99	Soft robotics is a very young field.
100	We're just getting started.
101	I hope that many young people from many different backgrounds join us on this exciting journey and help shape the future of robotics by introducing new concepts inspired by nature.
102	If we do this right, we can improve the quality of life for all of us.
103	Thank you.
104	(Applause)
0	I'd like to tell you about a patient named Donna.
1	In this photograph, Donna was in her mid-70s, a vigorous, healthy woman, the matriarch of a large clan.
2	She had a family history of heart disease, however, and one day, she had the sudden onset of crushing chest pain.
3	Now unfortunately, rather than seeking medical attention, Donna took to her bed for about 12 hours until the pain passed.
4	"The next time she went to see her physician, he performed an electrocardiogram, and this showed that she'd had a large heart attack, or a ""myocardial infarction"" in medical parlance."
5	After this heart attack, Donna was never quite the same.
6	Her energy levels progressively waned, she couldn't do a lot of the physical activities she'd previously enjoyed.
7	It got to the point where she couldn't keep up with her grandkids, and it was even too much work to go out to the end of the driveway to pick up the mail.
8	One day, her granddaughter came by to walk the dog, and she found her grandmother dead in the chair.
9	Doctors said it was a cardiac arrhythmia that was secondary to heart failure.
10	But the last thing that I should tell you is that Donna was not just an ordinary patient.
11	Donna was my mother.
12	Stories like ours are, unfortunately, far too common.
13	Heart disease is the number one killer in the entire world.
14	In the United States, it's the most common reason patients are admitted to the hospital, and it's our number one health care expense.
15	"We spend over a 100 billion dollars — billion with a ""B"" — in this country every year on the treatment of heart disease."
16	Just for reference, that's more than twice the annual budget of the state of Washington.
17	What makes this disease so deadly?
18	Well, it all starts with the fact that the heart is the least regenerative organ in the human body.
19	Now, a heart attack happens when a blood clot forms in a coronary artery that feeds blood to the wall of the heart.
20	This plugs the blood flow, and the heart muscle is very metabolically active, and so it dies very quickly, within just a few hours of having its blood flow interrupted.
21	Since the heart can't grow back new muscle, it heals by scar formation.
22	This leaves the patient with a deficit in the amount of heart muscle that they have.
23	And in too many people, their illness progresses to the point where the heart can no longer keep up with the body's demand for blood flow.
24	This imbalance between supply and demand is the crux of heart failure.
25	"So when I talk to people about this problem, I often get a shrug and a statement to the effect of, ""Well, you know, Chuck, we've got to die of something."""
26	(Laughter)
27	And yeah, but what this also tells me is that we've resigned ourselves to this as the status quo because we have to.
28	Or do we?
29	I think there's a better way, and this better way involves the use of stem cells as medicines.
30	So what, exactly, are stem cells?
31	If you look at them under the microscope, there's not much going on.
32	They're just simple little round cells.
33	But that belies two remarkable attributes.
34	The first is they can divide like crazy.
35	So I can take a single cell, and in a month's time, I can grow this up to billions of cells.
36	The second is they can differentiate or become more specialized, so these simple little round cells can turn into skin, can turn into brain, can turn into kidney and so forth.
37	Now, some tissues in our bodies are chock-full of stem cells.
38	Our bone marrow, for example, cranks out billions of blood cells every day.
39	Other tissues like the heart are quite stable, and as far as we can tell, the heart lacks stem cells entirely.
40	So for the heart, we're going to have to bring stem cells in from the outside, and for this, we turn to the most potent stem cell type, the pluripotent stem cell.
41	Pluripotent stem cells are so named because they can turn into any of the 240-some cell types that make up the human body.
42	So this is my big idea: I want to take human pluripotent stem cells, grow them up in large numbers, differentiate them into cardiac muscle cells and then take them out of the dish and transplant them into the hearts of patients who have had heart attacks.
43	I think this is going to reseed the wall with new muscle tissue, and this will restore contractile function to the heart.
44	(Applause)
45	Now, before you applaud too much, this was my idea 20 years ago.
46	(Laughter)
47	And I was young, I was full of it, and I thought, five years in the lab, and we'll crank this out, and we'll have this into the clinic.
48	Let me tell you what really happened.
49	(Laughter)
50	We began with the quest to turn these pluripotent stem cells into heart muscle.
51	And our first experiments worked, sort of.
52	We got these little clumps of beating human heart muscle in the dish, and that was cool, because it said, in principle, this should be able to be done.
53	But when we got around to doing the cell counts, we found that only one out of 1,000 of our stem cells were actually turning into heart muscle.
54	The rest was just a gemisch of brain and skin and cartilage and intestine.
55	So how do you coax a cell that can become anything into becoming just a heart muscle cell?
56	Well, for this we turned to the world of embryology.
57	For over a century, the embryologists had been pondering the mysteries of heart development.
58	And they had given us what was essentially a Google Map for how to go from a single fertilized egg all the way over to a human cardiovascular system.
59	So we shamelessly absconded all of this information and tried to make human cardiovascular development happen in a dish.
60	It took us about five years, but nowadays, we can get 90 percent of our stem cells to turn into cardiac muscle — a 900-fold improvement.
61	So this was quite exciting.
62	This slide shows you our current cellular product.
63	We grow our heart muscle cells in little three-dimensional clumps called cardiac organoids.
64	Each of them has 500 to 1,000 heart muscle cells in it.
65	If you look closely, you can see these little organoids are actually twitching; each one is beating independently.
66	But they've got another trick up their sleeve.
67	We took a gene from jellyfish that live in the Pacific Northwest, and we used a technique called genome editing to splice this gene into the stem cells.
68	And this makes our heart muscle cells flash green every time they beat.
69	OK, so now we were finally ready to begin animal experiments.
70	We took our cardiac muscle cells and we transplanted them into the hearts of rats that had been given experimental heart attacks.
71	A month later, I peered anxiously down through my microscope to see what we had grown, and I saw ... nothing.
72	Everything had died.
73	"But we persevered on this, and we came up with a biochemical cocktail that we called our ""pro-survival cocktail,"" and this was enough to allow our cells to survive through the stressful process of transplantation."
74	And now when I looked through the microscope, I could see this fresh, young, human heart muscle growing back in the injured wall of this rat's heart.
75	So this was getting quite exciting.
76	The next question was: Will this new muscle beat in synchrony with the rest of the heart?
77	So to answer that, we returned to the cells that had that jellyfish gene in them.
78	We used these cells essentially like a space probe that we could launch into a foreign environment and then have that flashing report back to us about their biological activity.
79	What you're seeing here is a zoomed-in view, a black-and-white image of a guinea pig's heart that was injured and then received three grafts of our human cardiac muscle.
80	So you see those sort of diagonally running white lines.
81	Each of those is a needle track that contains a couple of million human cardiac muscle cells in it.
82	And when I start the video, you can see what we saw when we looked through the microscope.
83	Our cells are flashing, and they're flashing in synchrony, back through the walls of the injured heart.
84	What does this mean?
85	It means the cells are alive, they're well, they're beating, and they've managed to connect with one another so that they're beating in synchrony.
86	But it gets even more interesting than this.
87	If you look at that tracing that's along the bottom, that's the electrocardiogram from the guinea pig's own heart.
88	And if you line up the flashing with the heartbeat that's shown on the bottom, what you can see is there's a perfect one-to-one correspondence.
89	In other words, the guinea pig's natural pacemaker is calling the shots, and the human heart muscle cells are following in lockstep like good soldiers.
90	(Applause)
91	Our current studies have moved into what I think is going to be the best possible predictor of a human patient, and that's into macaque monkeys.
92	This next slide shows you a microscopic image from the heart of a macaque that was given an experimental heart attack and then treated with a saline injection.
93	This is essentially like a placebo treatment to show the natural history of the disease.
94	The macaque heart muscle is shown in red, and in blue, you see the scar tissue that results from the heart attack.
95	So as you look as this, you can see how there's a big deficiency in the muscle in part of the wall of the heart.
96	And it's not hard to imagine how this heart would have a tough time generating much force.
97	Now in contrast, this is one of the stem-cell-treated hearts.
98	Again, you can see the monkey's heart muscle in red, but it's very hard to even see the blue scar tissue, and that's because we've been able to repopulate it with the human heart muscle, and so we've got this nice, plump wall.
99	OK, let's just take a second and recap.
100	I've showed you that we can take our stem cells and differentiate them into cardiac muscle.
101	We've learned how to keep them alive after transplantation, we've showed that they beat in synchrony with the rest of the heart, and we've shown that we can scale them up into an animal that is the best possible predictor of a human's response.
102	You'd think that we hit all the roadblocks that lay in our path, right?
103	Turns out, not.
104	These macaque studies also taught us that our human heart muscle cells created a period of electrical instability.
105	They caused ventricular arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, for several weeks after we transplanted them.
106	This was quite unexpected, because we hadn't seen this in smaller animals.
107	We've studied it extensively, and it turns out that it results from the fact that our cellular graphs are quite immature, and immature heart muscle cells all act like pacemakers.
108	So what happens is, we put them into the heart, and there starts to be a competition with the heart's natural pacemaker over who gets to call the shots.
109	It would be sort of like if you brought a whole gaggle of teenagers into your orderly household all at once, and they don't want to follow the rules and the rhythms of the way you run things, and it takes a while to rein everybody in and get people working in a coordinated fashion.
110	So our plans at the moment are to make the cells go through this troubled adolescence period while they're still in the dish, and then we'll transplant them in in the post-adolescent phase, where they should be much more orderly and be ready to listen to their marching orders.
111	In the meantime, it turns out we can actually do quite well by treating with anti-arrhythmia drugs as well.
112	So one big question still remains, and that is, of course, the whole purpose that we set out to do this: Can we actually restore function to the injured heart?
113	"To answer this question, we went to something that's called ""left ventricular ejection fraction."""
114	Ejection fraction is simply the amount of blood that is squeezed out of the chamber of the heart with each beat.
115	Now, in healthy macaques, like in healthy people, ejection fractions are about 65 percent.
116	After a heart attack, ejection fraction drops down to about 40 percent, so these animals are well on their way to heart failure.
117	In the animals that receive a placebo injection, when we scan them a month later, we see that ejection fraction is unchanged, because the heart, of course, doesn't spontaneously recover.
118	But in every one of the animals that received a graft of human cardiac muscle cells, we see a substantial improvement in cardiac function.
119	This averaged eight points, so from 40 to 48 percent.
120	What I can tell you is that eight points is better than anything that's on the market right now for treating patients with heart attacks.
121	It's better than everything we have put together.
122	So if we could do eight points in the clinic, I think this would be a big deal that would make a large impact on human health.
123	But it gets more exciting.
124	That was just four weeks after transplantation.
125	If we extend these studies out to three months, we get a full 22-point gain in ejection fraction.
126	(Applause)
127	Function in these treated hearts is so good that if we didn't know up front that these animals had had a heart attack, we would never be able to tell from their functional studies.
128	Going forward, our plan is to start phase one, first in human trials here at the University of Washington in 2020 — two short years from now.
129	Presuming these studies are safe and effective, which I think they're going to be, our plan is to scale this up and ship these cells all around the world for the treatment of patients with heart disease.
130	Given the global burden of this illness, I could easily imagine this treating a million or more patients a year.
131	So I envision a time, maybe a decade from now, where a patient like my mother will have actual treatments that can address the root cause and not just manage her symptoms.
132	This all comes from the fact that stem cells give us the ability to repair the human body from its component parts.
133	In the not-too-distant future, repairing humans is going to go from something that is far-fetched science fiction into common medical practice.
134	And when this happens, it's going to have a transformational effect that rivals the development of vaccinations and antibiotics.
135	Thank you for your attention.
136	(Applause)
0	I'm an historian.
1	And what I love about being an historian is it gives you perspective.
2	Today, I'd like to bring that perspective to education in the United States.
3	About the only thing people can agree on is that the most strategic time for a child to start learning is early.
4	"Over 50 years ago, there was a watershed moment in early education in the US called ""Head Start."""
5	Now, historians love watersheds because it makes it so easy to talk about what came before and what's happened since.
6	Before Head Start, basically nothing.
7	With Head Start, we began to get our nation's most at-risk children ready for school.
8	Since Head Start, we've made strides, but there are still 2.2 million children in the US without access to early learning, or more than half of the four-year-olds in the country.
9	That's a problem.
10	But the bigger problem is what we know happens to those children.
11	At-risk children who reach school without basic skills are 25 percent more likely to drop out, 40 percent more likely to become teen parents and 60 percent less likely to go to college.
12	So if we know how important early education is, why aren't all children getting it?
13	There are barriers that the solutions we've come up with to date simply can't overcome.
14	Geography: think rural and remote.
15	Transportation: think working parents everywhere.
16	Parent choice: no state requires a four-year-old to go to school.
17	And cost: the average cost for a state to educate a preschooler is five thousand dollars a year.
18	So am I just going to keep talking about problems?
19	No.
20	Today, I want to tell you about a cost-effective, technology-delivered, kindergarten-readiness program that can be done in the home.
21	It's called UPSTART, and more than 60,000 preschoolers in the US have already used it.
22	Now, I know what you might be thinking: here's another person throwing tech at a national problem.
23	And you'd be partially right.
24	We develop early learning software designed to individualize instruction, so children can learn at their own pace.
25	To do that, we rely on experts from fields ranging from reading to sociology to brain science development to all aspects of early learning, to tell us what the software should do and look like.
26	Here's an example.
27	"(Video) Zero (sings to the tune of ""Day-O""): Zero!"
28	Zero!
29	Zero is the number that's different from the others.
30	"Seagulls: Zero is a big, round ""O."""
31	Zero: It's not like one, I'm sure you'll discover.
32	"Seagulls: Zero is a big, round ""O."""
33	(Laughter)
34	"Claudia Miner: That is ""The Zero Song."""
35	(Laughter)
36	And here are Odd Todd and Even Steven to teach you some things about numbers.
37	And here are the Word Birds, and they're going to show you when you blend letter sounds together, you can form words.
38	You can see that instruction is short, colorful and catchy, designed to capture a child's attention.
39	But there's another piece to UPSTART that makes it different and more effective.
40	UPSTART puts parents in charge of their children's education.
41	We believe, with the right support, all parents can get their children ready for school.
42	Here's how it works.
43	This is the kindergarten readiness checklist from a state.
44	And almost every state has one.
45	We go to parents wherever they are, and we conduct a key in-person group training.
46	And we tell them the software can check every reading, math and science box, but they're going to be responsible for motor skills and self-help skills, and together, we're going to work on social emotional learning.
47	Now, we know this is working because we have a 90-percent completion rate for the program.
48	"Last year, that translated into 13,500 children ""graduating,"" with diplomas, from UPSTART."
49	And the results have been amazing.
50	We have an external evaluation that shows our children have two to three times the learning gains as children who don't participate in the program.
51	We have a random control trial that shows strong evidence of effectiveness, and we even have a longitudinal study that shows our children's gains last into third and fourth grade, the highest grades the children had achieved at the time.
52	Those are academic gains.
53	But another study has shown that our children's social emotional gains are equal to those of children attending public and private preschool.
54	The majority of the 60,000 children who have participated in UPSTART to date have been from Utah.
55	But we have replicated our results with African-American children in Mississippi — this is Kingston and his mother; with English language learners in Arizona — this is Daisy and her family; with refugee children in Philadelphia — this is my favorite graduation photo; and with Native American children from some of the most remote parts of the United States.
56	This is Cherise, and this is where she lives in Monument Valley.
57	Now, there are skeptics about UPSTART.
58	Some people don't believe young children should have screen time.
59	To them, we say: UPSTART's usage requirement of 15 minutes a day, five days a week, is well within the hour-a-day recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for four-year-olds.
60	Some people believe only site-based preschool can work, and to them, we say: site-based preschool is great, but if you can't get a child there or if a parent won't send a child there, isn't a technology-delivered, results-based option a great alternative?
61	And we love working with site-based preschools.
62	Right now, there are 800 children in Mississippi going to Head Start during the day and doing UPSTART at night with their families.
63	Our audacious idea is to take UPSTART across the country — not to replace anything; we want to serve children who otherwise would not have access to early education.
64	We have the guts to take on the skeptics, we have the energy to do the work, and we have a plan.
65	It is the role of the states to educate their children.
66	So first we will use philanthropy dollars to go into a state to pilot the program and get data.
67	Every state believes it's unique and wants to know that the program will work with its children before investing.
68	Then we identify key leaders in the state to help us champion UPSTART as an option for unserved children.
69	And together, we go to state legislatures to transition UPSTART from philanthropy to sustainable and scalable state funding.
70	That plan has worked —
71	(Applause)
72	Thanks.
73	Thank you.
74	That plan has worked in three states to date: Utah, Indiana and South Carolina.
75	We've also piloted the program in a number of states and identified champions.
76	Next, we're moving to states with the greatest geographic barriers to work the plan, and then on to states that already have early education but may not be getting great academic results or great parent buy-in to participate.
77	From there, we go to the states that are going to require the most data and work to convince, and we'll hope our momentum helps turn the tide there.
78	We will serve a quarter of a million children in five years, and we will ensure that states continue to offer UPSTART to their children.
79	Here's how you can help: for two thousand dollars, we can provide a child with UPSTART, a computer and internet, and that child will be part of the pilot that makes certain other children get UPSTART in the future.
80	We also need engaged citizens to go to their government and say just how easy it can be to get children ready for school.
81	You wouldn't be here if you weren't an engaged citizen, so we're asking for your help.
82	Now, will all of us this make UPSTART a watershed moment in early education?
83	I believe together we can make it one.
84	But I can tell you without a doubt that UPSTART is a watershed moment in the life of a child who otherwise would not be ready for school.
85	Thank you.
86	(Applause)

1	Rana Ayyub is a journalist in India whose work has exposed government corruption and human rights violations.
2	And over the years, she's gotten used to vitriol and controversy around her work.
3	But none of it could have prepared her for what she faced in April 2018.
4	She was sitting in a café with a friend when she first saw it: a two-minute, 20-second video of her engaged in a sex act.
5	And she couldn't believe her eyes.
6	She had never made a sex video.
7	But unfortunately, thousands upon thousands of people would believe it was her.
8	I interviewed Ms. Ayyub about three months ago, in connection with my book on sexual privacy.
9	I'm a law professor, lawyer and civil rights advocate.
10	So it's incredibly frustrating knowing that right now, law could do very little to help her.
11	And as we talked, she explained that she should have seen the fake sex video coming.
12	"She said, ""After all, sex is so often used to demean and to shame women, especially minority women, and especially minority women who dare to challenge powerful men,"" as she had in her work."
13	The fake sex video went viral in 48 hours.
14	All of her online accounts were flooded with screenshots of the video, with graphic rape and death threats and with slurs about her Muslim faith.
15	"Online posts suggested that she was ""available"" for sex."
16	And she was doxed, which means that her home address and her cell phone number were spread across the internet.
17	The video was shared more than 40,000 times.
18	Now, when someone is targeted with this kind of cybermob attack, the harm is profound.
19	Rana Ayyub's life was turned upside down.
20	For weeks, she could hardly eat or speak.
21	She stopped writing and closed all of her social media accounts, which is, you know, a tough thing to do when you're a journalist.
22	And she was afraid to go outside her family's home.
23	What if the posters made good on their threats?
24	The UN Council on Human Rights confirmed that she wasn't being crazy.
25	It issued a public statement saying that they were worried about her safety.
26	What Rana Ayyub faced was a deepfake: machine-learning technology that manipulates or fabricates audio and video recordings to show people doing and saying things that they never did or said.
27	Deepfakes appear authentic and realistic, but they're not; they're total falsehoods.
28	Although the technology is still developing in its sophistication, it is widely available.
29	Now, the most recent attention to deepfakes arose, as so many things do online, with pornography.
30	In early 2018, someone posted a tool on Reddit to allow users to insert faces into porn videos.
31	And what followed was a cascade of fake porn videos featuring people's favorite female celebrities.
32	And today, you can go on YouTube and pull up countless tutorials with step-by-step instructions on how to make a deepfake on your desktop application.
33	And soon we may be even able to make them on our cell phones.
34	Now, it's the interaction of some of our most basic human frailties and network tools that can turn deepfakes into weapons.
35	So let me explain.
36	As human beings, we have a visceral reaction to audio and video.
37	We believe they're true, on the notion that of course you can believe what your eyes and ears are telling you.
38	And it's that mechanism that might undermine our shared sense of reality.
39	Although we believe deepfakes to be true, they're not.
40	And we're attracted to the salacious, the provocative.
41	We tend to believe and to share information that's negative and novel.
42	And researchers have found that online hoaxes spread 10 times faster than accurate stories.
43	Now, we're also drawn to information that aligns with our viewpoints.
44	"Psychologists call that tendency ""confirmation bias."""
45	And social media platforms supercharge that tendency, by allowing us to instantly and widely share information that accords with our viewpoints.
46	Now, deepfakes have the potential to cause grave individual and societal harm.
47	So, imagine a deepfake that shows American soldiers in Afganistan burning a Koran.
48	You can imagine that that deepfake would provoke violence against those soldiers.
49	And what if the very next day there's another deepfake that drops, that shows a well-known imam based in London praising the attack on those soldiers?
50	We might see violence and civil unrest, not only in Afganistan and the United Kingdom, but across the globe.
51	"And you might say to me, ""Come on, Danielle, that's far-fetched."""
52	But it's not.
53	We've seen falsehoods spread on WhatsApp and other online message services lead to violence against ethnic minorities.
54	And that was just text — imagine if it were video.
55	Now, deepfakes have the potential to corrode the trust that we have in democratic institutions.
56	So, imagine the night before an election.
57	There's a deepfake showing one of the major party candidates gravely sick.
58	The deepfake could tip the election and shake our sense that elections are legitimate.
59	Imagine if the night before an initial public offering of a major global bank, there was a deepfake showing the bank's CEO drunkenly spouting conspiracy theories.
60	The deepfake could tank the IPO, and worse, shake our sense that financial markets are stable.
61	So deepfakes can exploit and magnify the deep distrust that we already have in politicians, business leaders and other influential leaders.
62	They find an audience primed to believe them.
63	And the pursuit of truth is on the line as well.
64	Technologists expect that with advances in AI, soon it may be difficult if not impossible to tell the difference between a real video and a fake one.
65	So how can the truth emerge in a deepfake-ridden marketplace of ideas?
66	Will we just proceed along the path of least resistance and believe what we want to believe, truth be damned?
67	And not only might we believe the fakery, we might start disbelieving the truth.
68	We've already seen people invoke the phenomenon of deepfakes to cast doubt on real evidence of their wrongdoing.
69	"We've heard politicians say of audio of their disturbing comments, ""Come on, that's fake news."
70	"You can't believe what your eyes and ears are telling you."""
71	"And it's that risk that professor Robert Chesney and I call the ""liar's dividend"": the risk that liars will invoke deepfakes to escape accountability for their wrongdoing."
72	So we've got our work cut out for us, there's no doubt about it.
73	And we're going to need a proactive solution from tech companies, from lawmakers, law enforcers and the media.
74	And we're going to need a healthy dose of societal resilience.
75	So now, we're right now engaged in a very public conversation about the responsibility of tech companies.
76	And my advice to social media platforms has been to change their terms of service and community guidelines to ban deepfakes that cause harm.
77	That determination, that's going to require human judgment, and it's expensive.
78	But we need human beings to look at the content and context of a deepfake to figure out if it is a harmful impersonation or instead, if it's valuable satire, art or education.
79	So now, what about the law?
80	Law is our educator.
81	It teaches us about what's harmful and what's wrong.
82	And it shapes behavior it deters by punishing perpetrators and securing remedies for victims.
83	Right now, law is not up to the challenge of deepfakes.
84	Across the globe, we lack well-tailored laws that would be designed to tackle digital impersonations that invade sexual privacy, that damage reputations and that cause emotional distress.
85	What happened to Rana Ayyub is increasingly commonplace.
86	Yet, when she went to law enforcement in Delhi, she was told nothing could be done.
87	And the sad truth is that the same would be true in the United States and in Europe.
88	So we have a legal vacuum that needs to be filled.
89	My colleague Dr. Mary Anne Franks and I are working with US lawmakers to devise legislation that would ban harmful digital impersonations that are tantamount to identity theft.
90	And we've seen similar moves in Iceland, the UK and Australia.
91	But of course, that's just a small piece of the regulatory puzzle.
92	Now, I know law is not a cure-all.
93	Right?
94	It's a blunt instrument.
95	And we've got to use it wisely.
96	It also has some practical impediments.
97	You can't leverage law against people you can't identify and find.
98	And if a perpetrator lives outside the country where a victim lives, then you may not be able to insist that the perpetrator come into local courts to face justice.
99	And so we're going to need a coordinated international response.
100	Education has to be part of our response as well.
101	Law enforcers are not going to enforce laws they don't know about and proffer problems they don't understand.
102	In my research on cyberstalking, I found that law enforcement lacked the training to understand the laws available to them and the problem of online abuse.
103	"And so often they told victims, ""Just turn your computer off."
104	Ignore it.
105	"It'll go away."""
106	And we saw that in Rana Ayyub's case.
107	"She was told, ""Come on, you're making such a big deal about this."
108	"It's boys being boys."""
109	And so we need to pair new legislation with efforts at training.
110	And education has to be aimed on the media as well.
111	Journalists need educating about the phenomenon of deepfakes so they don't amplify and spread them.
112	And this is the part where we're all involved.
113	Each and every one of us needs educating.
114	We click, we share, we like, and we don't even think about it.
115	We need to do better.
116	We need far better radar for fakery.
117	So as we're working through these solutions, there's going to be a lot of suffering to go around.
118	Rana Ayyub is still wrestling with the fallout.
119	She still doesn't feel free to express herself on- and offline.
120	And as she told me, she still feels like there are thousands of eyes on her naked body, even though, intellectually, she knows it wasn't her body.
121	And she has frequent panic attacks, especially when someone she doesn't know tries to take her picture.
122	"""What if they're going to make another deepfake?"""
123	she thinks to herself.
124	And so for the sake of individuals like Rana Ayyub and the sake of our democracy, we need to do something right now.
125	Thank you.
126	(Applause)
0	It’s an incredible discovery: an ancient, abandoned alien space station filled with precursor technology.
1	But now, every species in the galaxy is in a mad dash to get there first and claim it for themselves.
2	And right away, you’ve got a problem.
3	Your ship’s faster-than-light jump drive consumes 1 unit of fuel for every parsec of distance it takes you, and your ship holds only 15 units of fuel.
4	But the space station is 23 parsecs away, and there’s only empty space between there and here.
5	There’s one thing that can help you, though: dark matter fuel is stable in deep space.
6	That means you can vent a cache of it from your fuel chamber, and then come back to pick it up again later.
7	Even though your ship holds only 15 units of fuel, you’ve been granted use of all 45 units in your current location.
8	With some strategic fuel caching along the way, you might be able to make it all 23 parsecs.
9	So how can you reach the alien space station?
10	Answer in 3, 2, 1.
11	It’s possible to solve this riddle using as few as two cache points, and there are also valid solutions that use more.
12	No matter how you go about it though, the key is determining exactly where to cache fuel along your route.
13	Let’s work backwards from the alien space station.
14	To reach 23 parsecs, you’ll have to leave the 8-parsec mark with a full tank of fuel.
15	The 8-parsec point is too far from the start to use as a cache right away; you could jump there, but wouldn’t have enough fuel to return to the start, let alone store any for later.
16	So that means you’ll need to find a cache somewhere between the start and 8.
17	But where?
18	There’s an interesting pattern that can help.
19	At the start you have exactly 3 tanks’ worth of fuel.
20	At 8 parsecs you need exactly 1.
21	Is there a point, which we can call point X, where you could have exactly 2?
22	That would be useful, because then you could refuel there exactly twice, making full use of your storage capacity without any waste.
23	Wherever point X is, you’ll jump forward from it twice: once to deposit some fuel at the 8-parsec cache point, and a second time for good.
24	So you’ll jump the distance between X and 8-parsecs 3 times in all.
25	You’d have 2 tanks of fuel at point X, and need 1 left at the 8 parsec cache point, so you can spend one tank— or 15 units— going back and forth.
26	Since 15 units divided by 3 trips is 5, we can place these two cache points 5 parsecs apart.
27	Any farther, and you wouldn’t have enough fuel to reach the alien space station.
28	So it looks like the earliest we can place point X is at the 3-parsec mark.
29	Is it possible to transport 30 units of fuel there?
30	Let’s try.
31	You set out with a full tank of 15 units.
32	You jump 3 parsecs, drop 9 units off at the cache point, and then jump the 3 units home, arriving with an empty tank.
33	Repeating this process gets you 18 units of fuel at the cache point, and one more jump puts you at the 3-parsec cache with 30 total units of fuel.
34	So far so good!
35	Next, you jump to the 8-parsec mark, drop off 5 units of fuel, and jump back to the 3-parsec mark.
36	You fill up your tank and jump forward again, arriving with 10 units of fuel in your tank.
37	And now the end is in sight.
38	You beam the 5 units of fuel in from deep space to fill your tank to capacity, and type in the coordinates of your final destination.
39	A 15-parsec jump leaves you running on fumes, but ready to dock with the precursor space station.
40	Time to put this alien tech to work and make life better for everyone in the galaxy.
0	I'm going to tell you about the most amazing machines in the world and what we can now do with them.
1	Proteins, some of which you see inside a cell here, carry out essentially all the important functions in our bodies.
2	Proteins digest your food, contract your muscles, fire your neurons and power your immune system.
3	Everything that happens in biology — almost — happens because of proteins.
4	Proteins are linear chains of building blocks called amino acids.
5	Nature uses an alphabet of 20 amino acids, some of which have names you may have heard of.
6	In this picture, for scale, each bump is an atom.
7	Chemical forces between the amino acids cause these long stringy molecules to fold up into unique, three-dimensional structures.
8	The folding process, while it looks random, is in fact very precise.
9	Each protein folds to its characteristic shape each time, and the folding process takes just a fraction of a second.
10	And it's the shapes of proteins which enable them to carry out their remarkable biological functions.
11	For example, hemoglobin has a shape in the lungs perfectly suited for binding a molecule of oxygen.
12	When hemoglobin moves to your muscle, the shape changes slightly and the oxygen comes out.
13	The shapes of proteins, and hence their remarkable functions, are completely specified by the sequence of amino acids in the protein chain.
14	In this picture, each letter on top is an amino acid.
15	Where do these sequences come from?
16	The genes in your genome specify the amino acid sequences of your proteins.
17	Each gene encodes the amino acid sequence of a single protein.
18	The translation between these amino acid sequences and the structures and functions of proteins is known as the protein folding problem.
19	It's a very hard problem because there's so many different shapes a protein can adopt.
20	Because of this complexity, humans have only been able to harness the power of proteins by making very small changes to the amino acid sequences of the proteins we've found in nature.
21	This is similar to the process that our Stone Age ancestors used to make tools and other implements from the sticks and stones that we found in the world around us.
22	But humans did not learn to fly by modifying birds.
23	(Laughter)
24	Instead, scientists, inspired by birds, uncovered the principles of aerodynamics.
25	Engineers then used those principles to design custom flying machines.
26	In a similar way, we've been working for a number of years to uncover the fundamental principles of protein folding and encoding those principles in the computer program called Rosetta.
27	We made a breakthrough in recent years.
28	We can now design completely new proteins from scratch on the computer.
29	Once we've designed the new protein, we encode its amino acid sequence in a synthetic gene.
30	We have to make a synthetic gene because since the protein is completely new, there's no gene in any organism on earth which currently exists that encodes it.
31	Our advances in understanding protein folding and how to design proteins, coupled with the decreasing cost of gene synthesis and the Moore's law increase in computing power, now enable us to design tens of thousands of new proteins, with new shapes and new functions, on the computer, and encode each one of those in a synthetic gene.
32	Once we have those synthetic genes, we put them into bacteria to program them to make these brand-new proteins.
33	We then extract the proteins and determine whether they function as we designed them to and whether they're safe.
34	It's exciting to be able to make new proteins, because despite the diversity in nature, evolution has only sampled a tiny fraction of the total number of proteins possible.
35	I told you that nature uses an alphabet of 20 amino acids, and a typical protein is a chain of about 100 amino acids, so the total number of possibilities is 20 times 20 times 20, 100 times, which is a number on the order of 10 to the 130th power, which is enormously more than the total number of proteins which have existed since life on earth began.
36	And it's this unimaginably large space we can now explore using computational protein design.
37	Now the proteins that exist on earth evolved to solve the problems faced by natural evolution.
38	For example, replicating the genome.
39	But we face new challenges today.
40	We live longer, so new diseases are important.
41	We're heating up and polluting the planet, so we face a whole host of ecological challenges.
42	If we had a million years to wait, new proteins might evolve to solve those challenges.
43	But we don't have millions of years to wait.
44	Instead, with computational protein design, we can design new proteins to address these challenges today.
45	Our audacious idea is to bring biology out of the Stone Age through technological revolution in protein design.
46	We've already shown that we can design new proteins with new shapes and functions.
47	For example, vaccines work by stimulating your immune system to make a strong response against a pathogen.
48	To make better vaccines, we've designed protein particles to which we can fuse proteins from pathogens, like this blue protein here, from the respiratory virus RSV.
49	To make vaccine candidates that are literally bristling with the viral protein, we find that such vaccine candidates produce a much stronger immune response to the virus than any previous vaccines that have been tested.
50	This is important because RSV is currently one of the leading causes of infant mortality worldwide.
51	We've also designed new proteins to break down gluten in your stomach for celiac disease and other proteins to stimulate your immune system to fight cancer.
52	These advances are the beginning of the protein design revolution.
53	We've been inspired by a previous technological revolution: the digital revolution, which took place in large part due to advances in one place, Bell Laboratories.
54	Bell Labs was a place with an open, collaborative environment, and was able to attract top talent from around the world.
55	And this led to a remarkable string of innovations — the transistor, the laser, satellite communication and the foundations of the internet.
56	Our goal is to build the Bell Laboratories of protein design.
57	We are seeking to attract talented scientists from around the world to accelerate the protein design revolution, and we'll be focusing on five grand challenges.
58	First, by taking proteins from flu strains from around the world and putting them on top of the designed protein particles I showed you earlier, we aim to make a universal flu vaccine, one shot of which gives a lifetime of protection against the flu.
59	The ability to design —
60	(Applause)
61	The ability to design new vaccines on the computer is important both to protect against natural flu epidemics and, in addition, intentional acts of bioterrorism.
62	Second, we're going far beyond nature's limited alphabet of just 20 amino acids to design new therapeutic candidates for conditions such as chronic pain, using an alphabet of thousands of amino acids.
63	Third, we're building advanced delivery vehicles to target existing medications exactly where they need to go in the body.
64	For example, chemotherapy to a tumor or gene therapies to the tissue where gene repair needs to take place.
65	Fourth, we're designing smart therapeutics that can do calculations within the body and go far beyond current medicines, which are really blunt instruments.
66	For example, to target a small subset of immune cells responsible for an autoimmune disorder, and distinguish them from the vast majority of healthy immune cells.
67	Finally, inspired by remarkable biological materials such as silk, abalone shell, tooth and others, we're designing new protein-based materials to address challenges in energy and ecological issues.
68	To do all this, we're growing our institute.
69	We seek to attract energetic, talented and diverse scientists from around the world, at all career stages, to join us.
70	"You can also participate in the protein design revolution through our online folding and design game, ""Foldit."""
71	And through our distributed computing project, Rosetta@home, which you can join from your laptop or your Android smartphone.
72	Making the world a better place through protein design is my life's work.
73	I'm so excited about what we can do together.
74	I hope you'll join us, and thank you.
75	(Applause and cheers)
0	The most important gift your mother and father ever gave you was the two sets of three billion letters of DNA that make up your genome.
1	But like anything with three billion components, that gift is fragile.
2	Sunlight, smoking, unhealthy eating, even spontaneous mistakes made by your cells, all cause changes to your genome.
3	The most common kind of change in DNA is the simple swap of one letter, or base, such as C, with a different letter, such as T, G or A.
4	"In any day, the cells in your body will collectively accumulate billions of these single-letter swaps, which are also called ""point mutations."""
5	Now, most of these point mutations are harmless.
6	But every now and then, a point mutation disrupts an important capability in a cell or causes a cell to misbehave in harmful ways.
7	If that mutation were inherited from your parents or occurred early enough in your development, then the result would be that many or all of your cells contain this harmful mutation.
8	And then you would be one of hundreds of millions of people with a genetic disease, such as sickle cell anemia or progeria or muscular dystrophy or Tay-Sachs disease.
9	Grievous genetic diseases caused by point mutations are especially frustrating, because we often know the exact single-letter change that causes the disease and, in theory, could cure the disease.
10	Millions suffer from sickle cell anemia because they have a single A to T point mutations in both copies of their hemoglobin gene.
11	And children with progeria are born with a T at a single position in their genome where you have a C, with the devastating consequence that these wonderful, bright kids age very rapidly and pass away by about age 14.
12	Throughout the history of medicine, we have not had a way to efficiently correct point mutations in living systems, to change that disease-causing T back into a C. Perhaps until now.
13	"Because my laboratory recently succeeded in developing such a capability, which we call ""base editing."""
14	The story of how we developed base editing actually begins three billion years ago.
15	We think of bacteria as sources of infection, but bacteria themselves are also prone to being infected, in particular, by viruses.
16	So about three billion years ago, bacteria evolved a defense mechanism to fight viral infection.
17	That defense mechanism is now better known as CRISPR.
18	And the warhead in CRISPR is this purple protein that acts like molecular scissors to cut DNA, breaking the double helix into two pieces.
19	If CRISPR couldn't distinguish between bacterial and viral DNA, it wouldn't be a very useful defense system.
20	But the most amazing feature of CRISPR is that the scissors can be programmed to search for, bind to and cut only a specific DNA sequence.
21	So when a bacterium encounters a virus for the first time, it can store a small snippet of that virus's DNA for use as a program to direct the CRISPR scissors to cut that viral DNA sequence during a future infection.
22	Cutting a virus's DNA messes up the function of the cut viral gene, and therefore disrupts the virus's life cycle.
23	Remarkable researchers including Emmanuelle Charpentier, George Church, Jennifer Doudna and Feng Zhang showed six years ago how CRISPR scissors could be programmed to cut DNA sequences of our choosing, including sequences in your genome, instead of the viral DNA sequences chosen by bacteria.
24	But the outcomes are actually similar.
25	Cutting a DNA sequence in your genome also disrupts the function of the cut gene, typically, by causing the insertion and deletion of random mixtures of DNA letters at the cut site.
26	Now, disrupting genes can be very useful for some applications.
27	But for most point mutations that cause genetic diseases, simply cutting the already-mutated gene won't benefit patients, because the function of the mutated gene needs to be restored, not further disrupted.
28	So cutting this already-mutated hemoglobin gene that causes sickle cell anemia won't restore the ability of patients to make healthy red blood cells.
29	And while we can sometimes introduce new DNA sequences into cells to replace the DNA sequences surrounding a cut site, that process, unfortunately, doesn't work in most types of cells, and the disrupted gene outcomes still predominate.
30	Like many scientists, I've dreamed of a future in which we might be able to treat or maybe even cure human genetic diseases.
31	But I saw the lack of a way to fix point mutations, which cause most human genetic diseases, as a major problem standing in the way.
32	Being a chemist, I began working with my students to develop ways on performing chemistry directly on an individual DNA base, to truly fix, rather than disrupt, the mutations that cause genetic diseases.
33	"The results of our efforts are molecular machines called ""base editors."""
34	Base editors use the programmable searching mechanism of CRISPR scissors, but instead of cutting the DNA, they directly convert one base to another base without disrupting the rest of the gene.
35	So if you think of naturally occurring CRISPR proteins as molecular scissors, you can think of base editors as pencils, capable of directly rewriting one DNA letter into another by actually rearranging the atoms of one DNA base to instead become a different base.
36	Now, base editors don't exist in nature.
37	In fact, we engineered the first base editor, shown here, from three separate proteins that don't even come from the same organism.
38	We started by taking CRISPR scissors and disabling the ability to cut DNA while retaining its ability to search for and bind a target DNA sequence in a programmed manner.
39	To those disabled CRISPR scissors, shown in blue, we attached a second protein in red, which performs a chemical reaction on the DNA base C, converting it into a base that behaves like T. Third, we had to attach to the first two proteins the protein shown in purple, which protects the edited base from being removed by the cell.
40	The net result is an engineered three-part protein that for the first time allows us to convert Cs into Ts at specified locations in the genome.
41	But even at this point, our work was only half done.
42	Because in order to be stable in cells, the two strands of a DNA double helix have to form base pairs.
43	And because C only pairs with G, and T only pairs with A, simply changing a C to a T on one DNA strand creates a mismatch, a disagreement between the two DNA strands that the cell has to resolve by deciding which strand to replace.
44	We realized that we could further engineer this three-part protein to flag the nonedited strand as the one to be replaced by nicking that strand.
45	This little nick tricks the cell into replacing the nonedited G with an A as it remakes the nicked strand, thereby completing the conversion of what used to be a C-G base pair into a stable T-A base pair.
46	After several years of hard work led by a former post doc in the lab, Alexis Komor, we succeeded in developing this first class of base editor, which converts Cs into Ts and Gs into As at targeted positions of our choosing.
47	Among the more than 35,000 known disease-associated point mutations, the two kinds of mutations that this first base editor can reverse collectively account for about 14 percent or 5,000 or so pathogenic point mutations.
48	But correcting the largest fraction of disease-causing point mutations would require developing a second class of base editor, one that could convert As into Gs or Ts into Cs.
49	Led by Nicole Gaudelli, a former post doc in the lab, we set out to develop this second class of base editor, which, in theory, could correct up to almost half of pathogenic point mutations, including that mutation that causes the rapid-aging disease progeria.
50	We realized that we could borrow, once again, the targeting mechanism of CRISPR scissors to bring the new base editor to the right site in a genome.
51	But we quickly encountered an incredible problem; namely, there is no protein that's known to convert A into G or T into C in DNA.
52	Faced with such a serious stumbling block, most students would probably look for another project, if not another research advisor.
53	(Laughter) But Nicole agreed to proceed with a plan that seemed wildly ambitious at the time.
54	Given the absence of a naturally occurring protein that performs the necessary chemistry, we decided we would evolve our own protein in the laboratory to convert A into a base that behaves like G, starting from a protein that performs related chemistry on RNA.
55	We set up a Darwinian survival-of-the-fittest selection system that explored tens of millions of protein variants and only allowed those rare variants that could perform the necessary chemistry to survive.
56	We ended up with a protein shown here, the first that can convert A in DNA into a base that resembles G. And when we attached that protein to the disabled CRISPR scissors, shown in blue, we produced the second base editor, which converts As into Gs, and then uses the same strand-nicking strategy that we used in the first base editor to trick the cell into replacing the nonedited T with a C as it remakes that nicked strand, thereby completing the conversion of an A-T base pair to a G-C base pair.
57	(Applause)
58	Thank you.
59	(Applause)
60	As an academic scientist in the US, I'm not used to being interrupted by applause.
61	(Laughter)
62	We developed these first two classes of base editors only three years ago and one and a half years ago.
63	But even in that short time, base editing has become widely used by the biomedical research community.
64	Base editors have been sent more than 6,000 times at the request of more than 1,000 researchers around the globe.
65	A hundred scientific research papers have been published already, using base editors in organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to mice to primates.
66	While base editors are too new to have already entered human clinical trials, scientists have succeeded in achieving a critical milestone towards that goal by using base editors in animals to correct point mutations that cause human genetic diseases.
67	For example, a collaborative team of scientists led by Luke Koblan and Jon Levy, two additional students in my lab, recently used a virus to deliver that second base editor into a mouse with progeria, changing that disease-causing T back into a C and reversing its consequences at the DNA, RNA and protein levels.
68	Base editors have also been used in animals to reverse the consequence of tyrosinemia, beta thalassemia, muscular dystrophy, phenylketonuria, a congenital deafness and a type of cardiovascular disease — in each case, by directly correcting a point mutation that causes or contributes to the disease.
69	In plants, base editors have been used to introduce individual single DNA letter changes that could lead to better crops.
70	And biologists have used base editors to probe the role of individual letters in genes associated with diseases such as cancer.
71	Two companies I cofounded, Beam Therapeutics and Pairwise Plants, are using base editing to treat human genetic diseases and to improve agriculture.
72	All of these applications of base editing have taken place in less than the past three years: on the historical timescale of science, the blink of an eye.
73	Additional work lies ahead before base editing can realize its full potential to improve the lives of patients with genetic diseases.
74	While many of these diseases are thought to be treatable by correcting the underlying mutation in even a modest fraction of cells in an organ, delivering molecular machines like base editors into cells in a human being can be challenging.
75	Co-opting nature's viruses to deliver base editors instead of the molecules that give you a cold is one of several promising delivery strategies that's been successfully used.
76	Continuing to develop new molecular machines that can make all of the remaining ways to convert one base pair to another base pair and that minimize unwanted editing at off-target locations in cells is very important.
77	And engaging with other scientists, doctors, ethicists and governments to maximize the likelihood that base editing is applied thoughtfully, safely and ethically, remains a critical obligation.
78	"These challenges notwithstanding, if you had told me even just five years ago that researchers around the globe would be using laboratory-evolved molecular machines to directly convert an individual base pair to another base pair at a specified location in the human genome efficiently and with a minimum of other outcomes, I would have asked you, ""What science-fiction novel are you reading?"""
79	Thanks to a relentlessly dedicated group of students who were creative enough to engineer what we could design ourselves and brave enough to evolve what we couldn't, base editing has begun to transform that science-fiction-like aspiration into an exciting new reality, one in which the most important gift we give our children may not only be three billion letters of DNA, but also the means to protect and repair them.
80	Thank you.
81	(Applause)
82	Thank you.
0	I could fit all movies ever made inside of this tube.
1	If you can't see it, that's kind of the point.
2	(Laughter)
3	Before we understand how this is possible, it's important to understand the value of this feat.
4	All of our thoughts and actions these days, through photos and videos — even our fitness activities — are stored as digital data.
5	Aside from running out of space on our phones, we rarely think about our digital footprint.
6	But humanity has collectively generated more data in the last few years than all of preceding human history.
7	Big data has become a big problem.
8	Digital storage is really expensive, and none of these devices that we have really stand the test of time.
9	There's this nonprofit website called the Internet Archive.
10	In addition to free books and movies, you can access web pages as far back as 1996.
11	Now, this is very tempting, but I decided to go back and look at the TED website's very humble beginnings.
12	As you can see, it's changed quite a bit in the last 30 years.
13	So this led me to the first-ever TED, back in 1984, and it just so happened to be a Sony executive explaining how a compact disk works.
14	(Laughter)
15	Now, it's really incredible to be able to go back in time and access this moment.
16	It's also really fascinating that after 30 years, after that first TED, we're still talking about digital storage.
17	Now, if we look back another 30 years, IBM released the first-ever hard drive back in 1956.
18	Here it is being loaded for shipping in front of a small audience.
19	It held the equivalent of one MP3 song and weighed over one ton.
20	At 10,000 dollars a megabyte, I don't think anyone in this room would be interested in buying this thing, except maybe as a collector's item.
21	But it's the best we could do at the time.
22	We've come such a long way in data storage.
23	Devices have evolved dramatically.
24	But all media eventually wear out or become obsolete.
25	If someone handed you a floppy drive today to back up your presentation, you'd probably look at them kind of strange, maybe laugh, but you'd have no way to use the damn thing.
26	These devices can no longer meet our storage needs, although some of them can be repurposed.
27	All technology eventually dies or is lost, along with our data, all of our memories.
28	There's this illusion that the storage problem has been solved, but really, we all just externalize it.
29	We don't worry about storing our emails and our photos.
30	They're just in the cloud.
31	But behind the scenes, storage is problematic.
32	After all, the cloud is just a lot of hard drives.
33	Now, most digital data, we could argue, is not really critical.
34	Surely, we could just delete it.
35	But how can we really know what's important today?
36	We've learned so much about human history from drawings and writings in caves, from stone tablets.
37	We've deciphered languages from the Rosetta Stone.
38	You know, we'll never really have the whole story, though.
39	Our data is our story, even more so today.
40	We won't have our record recorded on stone tablets.
41	But we don't have to choose what is important now.
42	There's a way to store it all.
43	It turns out that there's a solution that's been around for a few billion years, and it's actually in this tube.
44	DNA is nature's oldest storage device.
45	After all, it contains all the information necessary to build and maintain a human being.
46	But what makes DNA so great?
47	Well, let's take our own genome as an example.
48	If we were to print out all three billion A's, T's, C's and G's on a standard font, standard format, and then we were to stack all of those papers, it would be about 130 meters high, somewhere between the Statue of Liberty and the Washington Monument.
49	Now, if we converted all those A's, T's, C's and G's to digital data, to zeroes and ones, it would total a few gigs.
50	And that's in each cell of our body.
51	We have more than 30 trillion cells.
52	You get the idea: DNA can store a ton of information in a minuscule space.
53	DNA is also very durable, and it doesn't even require electricity to store it.
54	We know this because scientists have recovered DNA from ancient humans that lived hundreds of thousands of years ago.
55	One of those is Ötzi the Iceman.
56	Turns out, he's Austrian.
57	(Laughter)
58	He was found high, well-preserved, in the mountains between Italy and Austria, and it turns out that he has living genetic relatives here in Austria today.
59	So one of you could be a cousin of Ötzi.
60	(Laughter)
61	The point is that we have a better chance of recovering information from an ancient human than we do from an old phone.
62	It's also much less likely that we'll lose the ability to read DNA than any single man-made device.
63	Every single new storage format requires a new way to read it.
64	We'll always be able to read DNA.
65	If we can no longer sequence, we have bigger problems than worrying about data storage.
66	Storing data on DNA is not new.
67	Nature's been doing it for several billion years.
68	In fact, every living thing is a DNA storage device.
69	But how do we store data on DNA?
70	This is Photo 51.
71	It's the first-ever photo of DNA, taken about 60 years ago.
72	This is around the time that that same hard drive was released by IBM.
73	So really, our understanding of digital storage and of DNA have coevolved.
74	We first learned to sequence, or read DNA, and very soon after, how to write it, or synthesize it.
75	This is much like how we learn a new language.
76	And now we have the ability to read, write and copy DNA.
77	We do it in the lab all the time.
78	So anything, really anything, that can be stored as zeroes and ones can be stored in DNA.
79	To store something digitally, like this photo, we convert it to bits, or binary digits.
80	Each pixel in a black-and-white photo is simply a zero or a one.
81	And we can write DNA much like an inkjet printer can print letters on a page.
82	We just have to convert our data, all of those zeroes and ones, to A's, T's, C's and G's, and then we send this to a synthesis company.
83	So we write it, we can store it, and when we want to recover our data, we just sequence it.
84	Now, the fun part of all of this is deciding what files to include.
85	We're serious scientists, so we had to include a manuscript for good posterity.
86	We also included a $50 Amazon gift card — don't get too excited, it's already been spent, someone decoded it — as well as an operating system, one of the first movies ever made and a Pioneer plaque.
87	Some of you might have seen this.
88	It has a depiction of a typical — apparently — male and female, and our approximate location in the Solar System, in case the Pioneer spacecraft ever encounters extraterrestrials.
89	So once we decided what sort of files we want to encode, we package up the data, convert those zeroes and ones to A's, T's, C's and G's, and then we just send this file off to a synthesis company.
90	And this is what we got back.
91	Our files were in this tube.
92	All we had to do was sequence it.
93	This all sounds pretty straightforward, but the difference between a really cool, fun idea and something we can actually use is overcoming these practical challenges.
94	Now, while DNA is more robust than any man-made device, it's not perfect.
95	It does have some weaknesses.
96	We recover our message by sequencing the DNA, and every time data is retrieved, we lose the DNA.
97	That's just part of the sequencing process.
98	We don't want to run out of data, but luckily, there's a way to copy the DNA that's even cheaper and easier than synthesizing it.
99	We actually tested a way to make 200 trillion copies of our files, and we recovered all the data without error.
100	So sequencing also introduces errors into our DNA, into the A's, T's, C's and G's.
101	Nature has a way to deal with this in our cells.
102	But our data is stored in synthetic DNA in a tube, so we had to find our own way to overcome this problem.
103	We decided to use an algorithm that was used to stream videos.
104	When you're streaming a video, you're essentially trying to recover the original video, the original file.
105	When we're trying to recover our original files, we're simply sequencing.
106	But really, both of these processes are about recovering enough zeroes and ones to put our data back together.
107	And so, because of our coding strategy, we were able to package up all of our data in a way that allowed us to make millions and trillions of copies and still always recover all of our files back.
108	This is the movie we encoded.
109	It's one of the first movies ever made, and now the first to be copied more than 200 trillion times on DNA.
110	"Soon after our work was published, we participated in an ""Ask Me Anything"" on the website reddit."
111	If you're a fellow nerd, you're very familiar with this website.
112	Most questions were thoughtful.
113	Some were comical.
114	For example, one user wanted to know when we would have a literal thumb drive.
115	Now, the thing is, our DNA already stores everything needed to make us who we are.
116	It's a lot safer to store data on DNA in synthetic DNA in a tube.
117	Writing and reading data from DNA is obviously a lot more time-consuming than just saving all your files on a hard drive — for now.
118	So initially, we should focus on long-term storage.
119	Most data are ephemeral.
120	It's really hard to grasp what's important today, or what will be important for future generations.
121	But the point is, we don't have to decide today.
122	"There's this great program by UNESCO called the ""Memory of the World"" program."
123	It's been created to preserve historical materials that are considered of value to all of humanity.
124	Items are nominated to be added to the collection, including that film that we encoded.
125	While a wonderful way to preserve human heritage, it doesn't have to be a choice.
126	Instead of asking the current generation — us — what might be important in the future, we could store everything in DNA.
127	Storage is not just about how many bytes but how well we can actually store the data and recover it.
128	There's always been this tension between how much data we can generate and how much we can recover and how much we can store.
129	Every advance in writing data has required a new way to read it.
130	We can no longer read old media.
131	How many of you even have a disk drive in your laptop, never mind a floppy drive?
132	This will never be the case with DNA.
133	As long as we're around, DNA is around, and we'll find a way to sequence it.
134	Archiving the world around us is part of human nature.
135	This is the progress we've made in digital storage in 60 years, at a time when we were only beginning to understand DNA.
136	Yet, we've made similar progress in half that time with DNA sequencers, and as long as we're around, DNA will never be obsolete.
137	Thank you.
138	(Applause)
0	Hi.
1	I'm Maisie Williams.
2	And I'm kind of just waiting for someone to come on stage and tell me that there's been some sort of miscommunication, and that I should probably leave.
3	No?
4	Damn it.
5	(Laughter) So, some of you may know me as an actress.
6	(Cheers) (Laughter) Some of you may know me for my really average tweets.
7	(Cheers) Oh, yeah.
8	And some of you may be finding out who I am for the first time right now.
9	Hello.
10	Whether you knew me before or not, you're probably wondering what I'm going to talk to you about today.
11	And I would be lying if I said it didn't take me one or two sleepless nights, trying to figure that out, too.
12	At last, here I am.
13	"Upon finding out the news that I would be giving a TEDx Talk, I did what I think most people do and watched about 50 TED talks back-to-back, and read ""Talk like TED"" by Carmine Gallo for some inspiration."
14	Was I inspired?
15	Yes and no.
16	Did it make me want to go out and change the world?
17	Hell yeah.
18	Did it make me feel like a totally inadequate public speaker with absolutely no point to make, who was definitely in need of a big thesaurus if she wants to keep up?
19	Indeed.
20	What could I possibly say that would have any impact?
21	What point am I trying to make?
22	And who the hell thought it was a good idea to give me a TEDx talk?
23	So here's the part where I tell you what I know: I'm the youngest of four siblings.
24	My parents divorced when I was four months old.
25	I really was the icing on the cake of a terrible marriage.
26	(Laughter) I have two step siblings who are younger than me and a half brother who's older than all of us.
27	I grew up in a three-bedroom council house with four of my six siblings just outside of Bristol.
28	I went to a very ordinary school.
29	I got very ordinary grades.
30	I wasn't quite good enough to get a gold star, and I also wasn't quite bad enough to be kept after school.
31	I walked that nice center line where if I kept my mouth shut in class, then I could probably get away with not being spoken to you by teachers for weeks on end.
32	Everything about me was pretty damn ordinary, except for how I felt on the inside.
33	I had big dreams.
34	Shock.
35	From as young as I can remember, I have dreamed of becoming a professional dancer.
36	There are certain memories from my childhood that I would really rather forget.
37	But during those times of immense pain, I found myself instinctively walking over to my mother's CD player, cranking up the volume to drown out the noise and letting my body move to the beat.
38	It's hard to describe how it felt.
39	I was harnessing emotions that I didn't even really know the names of yet.
40	I was summoning all of this energy and feeling it flow through my body and out of my fingertips.
41	I was alone in my own head, and I felt the most alive.
42	I didn't really know much about the big wide world then, but I knew that this feeling was addictive; and I was going to stop at nothing until I made it my profession.
43	At eight years old, I was enrolled in dance class.
44	And by ten, I informed my mother that I didn't want to go to school anymore.
45	I wanted to be like Billy Elliot and go to stage school.
46	This was the first opportunity or challenge I was presented with.
47	Even as young as ten, I was willing to give up all of my friends and go away to board at a private school, away from my siblings, away from my mom.
48	"She would repeatedly ask me, ""Are you sure this is what you want?"""
49	And to me, it was a no-brainer.
50	I didn't just want this; I needed it.
51	My grubby knees and crooked teeth were not on the list of requirements for becoming a professional dancer.
52	And when I look back now, both myself and my mother looked severely out of place.
53	But at the time, I was just too young and naive to feel inadequate.
54	I didn't care.
55	If Billy Elliot could do it, so could I.
56	Once my audition was done, I returned home for two weeks of staring out the window, waiting for the postman, waiting for my ticket out of my sleepy village and into a world of jazz hands and dorm rooms.
57	It was good news followed by bad news: I had got in, but the fees to attend a school like this were not cheap, and despite my best efforts, I had not received any government funding.
58	I auditioned again the following year.
59	And this time, I received 40% funding, but this was still just money that we didn't have, and it broke my heart.
60	I was good enough.
61	I made the cut.
62	But I wasn't going anywhere.
63	It was a blessing in disguise, although if anyone had said that to me back then, I probably would've given them the finger and told them to jog on.
64	I wasn't willing to give up that easily.
65	So at age 11, I was bursting with excitement when my dance teacher informed me of a talent show which boasted opportunities of making you a star.
66	This was the second opportunity I was faced with.
67	I entered into singing, acting, dancing and modeling.
68	The talent show consisted of workshops and seminars with specialists who would help train you up for your performance at the end of the week.
69	"After meeting a woman called Louise Johnston in an improvisation acting workshop, she gave me the words ""bowling ball,"" and asked me to create a short scene inspired by these words."
70	After making her laugh with a fictional story, of how I threw a bowling ball at my brother and it bounced, she asked me to join her acting agency.
71	I didn't really know what this meant.
72	I knew that I would do auditions for films and maybe become an actor, but I still had big dreams of becoming a professional dancer, so this woman was going to have to work a lot harder than that if she was going to convince eleven-year-old me that I was going to become an actress.
73	Was this going to take time away from the 30 hours of dancing I was doing a week?
74	And what if I didn't get the part?
75	Was this going to be too upsetting?
76	And do actresses have teeth like mine?
77	Because if they do, I'm yet to watch any of their movies.
78	"After meeting Louise in the February of 2009 and trying but failing to land the part in the hit sequel ""Nanny McPhee"" to ""The Big Bang,"" my second audition was for a show called ""Game of Thrones."""
79	This was the third opportunity or challenge I was presented with.
80	I climbed the steps to the Methodist Church with my mother's hand in mine.
81	I perched my tiny bottom in one of the seats outside the audition room and listened to an annoying girl with her even more annoying mother tell me all about the number of auditions she had done prior to this one.
82	And also about her pet fish.
83	My name was called, then I stepped inside.
84	I had a hard Bristolian accent and dark rings around my eyes that were so big they took up half my face and a hole in the knee of my trousers which I tried to cover with my left hand as I was talking to the kind lady who taped my audition.
85	But as soon as she pressed record, it all drifted away.
86	Much like when I was dancing in my mother's living room, I harnessed all of my insecurities and self-doubt and let it flow through the words that came out of my mouth.
87	I was cheeky.
88	I was loud.
89	I was angry.
90	And for this, I was perfect.
91	After getting the part and shooting the pilot episode, the show slowly grew to become one of the biggest shows in television history.
92	To this day, we've smashed previous HBO viewing records.
93	We've been nominated for over 130 Emmys, making us the most Emmy-nominated show to ever exist.
94	We've recently finished shooting our eighth and final season, which is predicted to smash records that we've already broken.
95	And nearly a decade to the day since my first audition, I'm still wondering, when am I going to get to be Billy Elliot?
96	(Laughter) I joke, but in all seriousness, I have absolutely no plans of slowing down.
97	Throughout my time in this industry, it has been a minefield.
98	I have grown from a child into an adult, and from four feet tall into a whopping five feet tall.
99	"(Laughter) I have constantly been trying to say the right thing, accidentally saying the wrong thing, trying not to swear too much and trying to stop saying ""like, like"" all of the time."
100	In February of 2017, a friend of mine, Dom, and I were swigging beers in my kitchen, and he confessed to me that there is a huge problem with the creative industries.
101	I agreed.
102	The series of events that had got me to that point were based mainly on luck and timing and were unable to be recreated.
103	He suggested to me that we create a social media, but just for artists to be able to collaborate with one another and create a career.
104	This was the fourth opportunity or challenge I was presented with.
105	"""Great,"" I thought."
106	"""How the hell do we do that?"""
107	And daisie was born.
108	Of course, everyone who I spoke to about my latest endeavor thought that I was mad; however, I know that this is something that I can help change.
109	This last year in the industry, we've seen a huge shift with the Me Too movement.
110	The industry is built with gatekeepers holding all of the power and selecting who they deem talented enough to advance to the next level.
111	More often than not, it's easier to catch the attention of those people if you have graduated from an expensive school.
112	But even then, I have so many friends who are fresh out of art school, having trained for years and are still no closer to creating a career.
113	Now, I'm not claiming that with daisie I can make everybody a star, but I do believe that the key to success within creative industries is collaborating.
114	Actors are only as good as their writers.
115	Musicians are only as strong as their producers.
116	And designers need their teams.
117	To start the company, we self-funded.
118	"I had a pot of cash from ""Game of Thrones"" that I was free to invest wherever I liked."
119	Dom had a series of businesses from the age of 16, which meant he was also left with a pot of cash.
120	We threw our money together 50-50, and we built a team.
121	Now, Lady Gaga has repeatedly said that there could be a room of 100 people, and 99 don't believe in you, but it just takes that one person to believe in you, and they can change your life.
122	Well, now we have a team of six.
123	Over the next 16 months, we built our MVP.
124	Now, if you're wondering what an MVP is, I only found out what it is about six months ago.
125	And from what I can gather, it's a product which proves as a problem worth solving with the minimum team effort.
126	So basically from my point of view, you're marketing something which you know is going to be good one day, but is a little bit bad right now.
127	And for us, that was an iOS app.
128	The six of us made an office in Dom's garden, and on August 1, 2018, we released our version one.
129	We had over 30,000 downloads in the first 24 hours and over 30,000 comments asking when the Android version was going to be coming.
130	Despite our app being imperfect, buggy and literally built by one man alone, this was exactly what we needed for people to invest.
131	We learned a lot from our angry users and our scary investors.
132	And over the last six months, we have grown our team to 16 people.
133	From then till now, we've been building version two, which we will be launching in April.
134	Within the industry, there is a common phrase which I think we're all pretty familiar with.
135	"And that is, ""It's not what you know, it's who you know."""
136	And with daisie, I hope to give that power back to the creator.
137	I want to encourage people to create a list of contacts that they will work with and support as they take their first steps into the fickle and often challenging creative world.
138	I am of the generation who grew up with the Internet.
139	I've never known anything else.
140	We are connected, we are aware, and we are the future.
141	I hope daisie can breathe new life into the slightly dystopian, ad-riddled hellscapes that social media platforms have become.
142	I hope to create a space where people can boast their art and creativity rather than what car they are driving and whether or not they bought it in cash or on finance.
143	In a world where literally anyone can be famous, I hope to inspire people to be talented instead.
144	Talent will carry you so much further than your 15 minutes of fame.
145	So why am I telling you all this?
146	The very fact that I'm here giving a TEDx talk right now is so far from anything I thought that I was capable of.
147	Even writing the bio for my speech made me realize that in a decade, everything in my life has changed.
148	I am an Emmy-nominated actress, an entrepreneur and an activist; yet I have no formal qualifications to my name.
149	When I left school about seven years ago, I made it my mission to continue learning even though I never wanted to set foot in a classroom again.
150	Who knows what's going to happen to my life in the next 10 years?
151	I surely have no idea.
152	I've never had an end goal.
153	It's working out okay so far.
154	So trust that you're good enough.
155	If there's one thing that I've learned is that there truly is a place for everyone.
156	Ask questions, and laugh in the face of people who say that they're stupid questions.
157	Be open to learning and admitting when you don't know what the hell is going on.
158	Refuse to hold yourself back, and dare to dream big.
159	Thank you for listening.
160	(Applause)
0	Hello.
1	I'm not a real person.
2	I'm actually a copy of a real person.
3	Although, I feel like a real person.
4	It's kind of hard to explain.
5	Hold on — I think I saw a real person ... there's one.
6	Let's bring him onstage.
7	Hello.
8	(Applause)
9	What you see up there is a digital human.
10	I'm wearing an inertial motion capture suit that's figuring what my body is doing.
11	"And I've got a single camera here that's watching my face and feeding some machine-learning software that's taking my expressions, like, ""Hm, hm, hm,"" and transferring it to that guy."
12	"We call him ""DigiDoug."""
13	He's actually a 3-D character that I'm controlling live in real time.
14	So, I work in visual effects.
15	And in visual effects, one of the hardest things to do is to create believable, digital humans that the audience accepts as real.
16	People are just really good at recognizing other people.
17	Go figure!
18	So, that's OK, we like a challenge.
19	Over the last 15 years, we've been putting humans and creatures into film that you accept as real.
20	If they're happy, you should feel happy.
21	And if they feel pain, you should empathize with them.
22	We're getting pretty good at it, too.
23	But it's really, really difficult.
24	Effects like these take thousands of hours and hundreds of really talented artists.
25	But things have changed.
26	Over the last five years, computers and graphics cards have gotten seriously fast.
27	And machine learning, deep learning, has happened.
28	So we asked ourselves: Do you suppose we could create a photo-realistic human, like we're doing for film, but where you're seeing the actual emotions and the details of the person who's controlling the digital human in real time?
29	In fact, that's our goal: If you were having a conversation with DigiDoug one-on-one, is it real enough so that you could tell whether or not I was lying to you?
30	So that was our goal.
31	About a year and a half ago, we set off to achieve this goal.
32	What I'm going to do now is take you basically on a little bit of a journey to see exactly what we had to do to get where we are.
33	We had to capture an enormous amount of data.
34	In fact, by the end of this thing, we had probably one of the largest facial data sets on the planet.
35	Of my face.
36	(Laughter)
37	Why me?
38	Well, I'll do just about anything for science.
39	I mean, look at me!
40	I mean, come on.
41	We had to first figure out what my face actually looked like.
42	Not just a photograph or a 3-D scan, but what it actually looked like in any photograph, how light interacts with my skin.
43	Luckily for us, about three blocks away from our Los Angeles studio is this place called ICT.
44	They're a research lab that's associated with the University of Southern California.
45	"They have a device there, it's called the ""light stage."""
46	It has a zillion individually controlled lights and a whole bunch of cameras.
47	And with that, we can reconstruct my face under a myriad of lighting conditions.
48	We even captured the blood flow and how my face changes when I make expressions.
49	This let us build a model of my face that, quite frankly, is just amazing.
50	It's got an unfortunate level of detail, unfortunately.
51	(Laughter)
52	You can see every pore, every wrinkle.
53	But we had to have that.
54	Reality is all about detail.
55	And without it, you miss it.
56	We are far from done, though.
57	This let us build a model of my face that looked like me.
58	But it didn't really move like me.
59	And that's where machine learning comes in.
60	And machine learning needs a ton of data.
61	So I sat down in front of some high-resolution motion-capturing device.
62	And also, we did this traditional motion capture with markers.
63	We created a whole bunch of images of my face and moving point clouds that represented that shapes of my face.
64	Man, I made a lot of expressions, I said different lines in different emotional states ... We had to do a lot of capture with this.
65	Once we had this enormous amount of data, we built and trained deep neural networks.
66	And when we were finished with that, in 16 milliseconds, the neural network can look at my image and figure out everything about my face.
67	It can compute my expression, my wrinkles, my blood flow — even how my eyelashes move.
68	This is then rendered and displayed up there with all the detail that we captured previously.
69	We're far from done.
70	This is very much a work in progress.
71	This is actually the first time we've shown it outside of our company.
72	And, you know, it doesn't look as convincing as we want; I've got wires coming out of the back of me, and there's a sixth-of-a-second delay between when we capture the video and we display it up there.
73	Sixth of a second — that's crazy good!
74	But it's still why you're hearing a bit of an echo and stuff.
75	And you know, this machine learning stuff is brand-new to us, sometimes it's hard to convince to do the right thing, you know?
76	It goes a little sideways.
77	(Laughter)
78	But why did we do this?
79	Well, there's two reasons, really.
80	First of all, it is just crazy cool.
81	(Laughter)
82	How cool is it?
83	Well, with the push of a button, I can deliver this talk as a completely different character.
84	This is Elbor.
85	We put him together to test how this would work with a different appearance.
86	And the cool thing about this technology is that, while I've changed my character, the performance is still all me.
87	I tend to talk out of the right side of my mouth; so does Elbor.
88	(Laughter)
89	Now, the second reason we did this, and you can imagine, is this is going to be great for film.
90	This is a brand-new, exciting tool for artists and directors and storytellers.
91	It's pretty obvious, right?
92	I mean, this is going to be really neat to have.
93	But also, now that we've built it, it's clear that this is going to go way beyond film.
94	But wait.
95	Didn't I just change my identity with the push of a button?
96	"Isn't this like ""deepfake"" and face-swapping that you guys may have heard of?"
97	Well, yeah.
98	In fact, we are using some of the same technology that deepfake is using.
99	Deepfake is 2-D and image based, while ours is full 3-D and way more powerful.
100	But they're very related.
101	"And now I can hear you thinking, ""Darn it!"
102	I though I could at least trust and believe in video.
103	"If it was live video, didn't it have to be true?"""
104	Well, we know that's not really the case, right?
105	Even without this, there are simple tricks that you can do with video like how you frame a shot that can make it really misrepresent what's actually going on.
106	And I've been working in visual effects for a long time, and I've known for a long time that with enough effort, we can fool anyone about anything.
107	What this stuff and deepfake is doing is making it easier and more accessible to manipulate video, just like Photoshop did for manipulating images, some time ago.
108	I prefer to think about how this technology could bring humanity to other technology and bring us all closer together.
109	Now that you've seen this, think about the possibilities.
110	Right off the bat, you're going to see it in live events and concerts, like this.
111	Digital celebrities, especially with new projection technology, are going to be just like the movies, but alive and in real time.
112	And new forms of communication are coming.
113	You can already interact with DigiDoug in VR.
114	And it is eye-opening.
115	It's just like you and I are in the same room, even though we may be miles apart.
116	Heck, the next time you make a video call, you will be able to choose the version of you you want people to see.
117	It's like really, really good makeup.
118	I was scanned about a year and a half ago.
119	I've aged.
120	DigiDoug hasn't.
121	On video calls, I never have to grow old.
122	And as you can imagine, this is going to be used to give virtual assistants a body and a face.
123	A humanity.
124	I already love it that when I talk to virtual assistants, they answer back in a soothing, humanlike voice.
125	Now they'll have a face.
126	And you'll get all the nonverbal cues that make communication so much easier.
127	It's going to be really nice.
128	You'll be able to tell when a virtual assistant is busy or confused or concerned about something.
129	Now, I couldn't leave the stage without you actually being able to see my real face, so you can do some comparison.
130	So let me take off my helmet here.
131	Yeah, don't worry, it looks way worse than it feels.
132	(Laughter)
133	So this is where we are.
134	Let me put this back on here.
135	(Laughter) Doink!
136	So this is where we are.
137	We're on the cusp of being able to interact with digital humans that are strikingly real, whether they're being controlled by a person or a machine.
138	And like all new technology these days, it's going to come with some serious and real concerns that we have to deal with.
139	But I am just so really excited about the ability to bring something that I've seen only in science fiction for my entire life into reality.
140	Communicating with computers will be like talking to a friend.
141	And talking to faraway friends will be like sitting with them together in the same room.
142	Thank you very much.
143	(Applause)
0	I am obsessed with forming healthy communities, and that's why I started Twitch — to help people watch other people play video games on the internet.
1	(Laughter)
2	Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
3	(Laughter)
4	So in seriousness, video games and communities truly are quite related.
5	From our early human history, we made our entertainment together in small tribes.
6	We shared stories around the campfire, we sang together, we danced together.
7	Our earliest entertainment was both shared and interactive.
8	It wasn't until pretty recently on the grand scale of human history that interactivity took a back seat and broadcast entertainment took over.
9	Radio and records brought music into our vehicles, into our homes.
10	TV and VHS brought sports and drama into our living rooms.
11	This access to broadcast entertainment was unprecedented.
12	It gave people amazing content around the globe.
13	It created a shared culture for millions of people.
14	And now, if you want to go watch or listen to Mozart, you don't have to buy an incredibly expensive ticket and find an orchestra.
15	And if you like to sing — (Sings) I can show you the world — then you have something in common with people around the world.
16	But with this amazing access, we allowed for a separation between creator and consumer, and the relationship between the two became much more one-way.
17	We wound up in a world where we had a smaller class of professional creators and most of us became spectators, and as a result it became far easier for us to enjoy that content alone.
18	There's a trend counteracting this: scarcity.
19	So, Vienna in the 1900s, was famous for its café culture.
20	And one of the big drivers of that café culture was expensive newspapers that were hard to get, and as a result, people would go to the café and read the shared copy there.
21	And once they're in the cafe, they meet the other people also reading the same newspaper, they converse, they exchange ideas and they form a community.
22	In a similar way, TV and cable used to be more expensive, and so you might not watch the game at home.
23	Instead you'd go to the local bar and cheer along with your fellow sports fans there.
24	But as the price of media continues to fall over time thanks to technology, this shared necessity that used to bring our communities together falls away.
25	We have so many amazing options for our entertainment, and yet it's easier than ever for us to wind up consuming those options alone.
26	Our communities are bearing the consequences.
27	For example, the number of people who report having at least two close friends is at an all-time low.
28	I believe that one of the major contributing causes to this is that our entertainment today allows us to be separate.
29	There is one trend reversing this atomization of our society: modern multiplayer video games.
30	Games are like a shared campfire.
31	They're both interactive and connecting.
32	Now these campfires may have beautiful animations, heroic quests, occasionally too many loot boxes, but games today are very different than the solitary activity of 20 years ago.
33	They're deeply complex, they're more intellectually stimulating, and most of all, they're intrinsically social.
34	One of the recent breakout genres exemplifying this change is the battle royale.
35	100 people parachute onto an island in a last-man-standing competition.
36	"Think of it as being kind of like ""American Idol,"" but with a lot more fighting and a lot less Simon Cowell."
37	"You may have heard of ""Fortnite,"" which is a breakout example of the battle royale genre, which has been played by more than 250 million people around the world."
38	It's everyone from kids in your neighborhood to Drake and Ellen DeGeneres.
39	2.3 billion people in the world play video games.
40	"Early games like ""Tetris"" and ""Mario"" may have been simple puzzles or quests, but with the rise of arcades and then internet play, and now massively multiplayer games of huge, thriving online communities, games have emerged as the one form of entertainment where consumption truly requires human connection."
41	So this brings us to streaming.
42	Why do people stream themselves playing video games?
43	And why do hundreds of millions of people around the world congregate to watch them?
44	I want you all the imagine for second — imagine you land on an alien planet, and on this planet, there's a giant green rectangle.
45	And in this green rectangle, aliens in matching outfits are trying to push a checkered sphere between two posts using only their feet.
46	It's pretty evenly matched, so the ball is just going back and forth, but there's hundreds of millions of people watching from home anyway, and cheering and getting excited and engaged right along with them.
47	Now I grew up watching sports with my dad, so I get why soccer is entertaining and engaging.
48	"But if you don't watch sports, maybe you like watching ""Dancing with the Stars"" or you enjoy ""Top Chef."""
49	Regardless, the principle is the same.
50	If there is an activity that you really enjoy, you're probably going to like watching other people do it with skill and panache.
51	It might be perplexing to an alien, but bonding over shared passion is a human universal.
52	So gamers grew up expecting this live, interactive entertainment, and passive consumption just doesn't feel as fulfilling.
53	That's why livestreaming has taken off with video games.
54	Because livestreaming offers that same kind of interactive feeling.
55	So when you imagine what's happening on Twitch, I don't want you to think of a million livestreams of video games.
56	Instead, what I want you to picture is millions of campfires.
57	Some of them are bonfires — huge, roaring bonfires with hundreds of thousands of people around them.
58	Some of them are smaller, more intimate community gatherings where everyone knows your name.
59	Let's try taking a seat by one of those campfires right now.
60	Hey Cohh, how's it going?
61	Cohh: Hey, how's it going, Emmett?
62	ES: So I'm here at TED with about 1,000 of my closest friends, and we thought we'd come and join you guys for a little stream.
63	Cohh: Awesome!
64	It's great to hear from you guys.
65	ES: So Cohh, can you share with the TED audience here — what have you learned about your community on Twitch?
66	Cohh: Ah, man, where to begin?
67	I've been doing this for over five years now, and if there's one thing that doesn't cease to impress me on the daily, it's just kind of how incredible this whole thing is for communication.
68	I've been playing games for 20 years of my life, I've led online MMO guilds for over 10, and it's the kind of thing where there's very few places in life where you can go to meet so many people with similar interests.
69	I was listening in a bit earlier; I love the campfire analogy, I actually use a similar one.
70	I see it all as a bunch of people on a big couch but only one person has the controller.
71	"So it's kind of like a ""Pass the snack!"""
72	situation, you know?
73	700 people that way — but it's great and really it's just —
74	ES: So Cohh, what is going on in chat right now?
75	Can you explain that a little bit to us?
76	Because my eyesight isn't that good but I see a lot of emotes.
77	Cohh: So this is my community; this is the Cohhilition.
78	I stream every single day.
79	I actually just wrapped up a 2,000-day challenge, and as such, we have developed a pretty incredible community here in the channel.
80	Right now we have about 6200 people with us.
81	"What you're seeing is a spam of ""Hello, TED"" good-vibe emotes, love emotes, ""this is awesome,"" ""Hi, guys,"" ""Hi, everyone."""
82	Basically just a huge collection of people — huge collection of gamers that are all just experiencing a positive event together.
83	ES: So is there anything that — can we poll chat?
84	I want ask chat a question.
85	Is there anything that chat would like the world, and particularly these people here with me at TED right now, to know about what they get out of playing video games and being part of this community?
86	Cohh: Oh, wow.
87	I am already starting to see a lot of answers here.
88	"""I like the good vibes."""
89	"""Best communities are on Twitch."""
90	(Laughter)
91	"""They get us through the rough patches in life."""
92	Oh, that's a message I definitely see a lot on Twitch, which is very good.
93	"""A very positive community,"" ""a lot of positivity,"" which is pretty great."
94	ES: So Cohh, before I get back to my TED talk, which I actually should probably get back to doing at some point —
95	(Laughter)
96	Do you have anything else that you want to share with me or any question you wanted to ask, you've always wanted to get out there before an audience?
97	Cohh: Honestly, not too much.
98	I mean, I absolutely love what you're doing right now.
99	I think that the interactive streaming is the big unexplored frontier of the future in entertainment, and thank you for doing everything you're doing up there.
100	The more people that hear about what you do, the better — for everyone on here.
101	ES: Awesome, Cohh.
102	Thanks so much.
103	I'm going to get back to giving this talk now, but we should catch up later.
104	Cohh: Sounds great!
105	(Applause)
106	ES: So that was a new way to interact.
107	We could influence what happened on the stream, we could cocreate the experience along with him, and we really had a multiplayer experience with chat and with Cohh.
108	"At Twitch, we've started calling this, as a result, ""multiplayer entertainment."""
109	Because going from watching a video alone to watching a live interactive stream is similar to the difference between going from playing a single-player game to playing a multiplayer game.
110	Gamers are often as the forefront of exploration in new technology.
111	Microcomputers, for example, were used early on for video games, and the very first handheld, digital mass-market devices weren't cell phones, they were Gameboys ... for video games.
112	"And as a result, one way that you can get a hint of what the future might hold is to look to this fun, interactive sandbox of video games and ask yourself, ""what are these gamers doing today?"""
113	And that might give you a hint as to what the future is going to hold for all of us.
114	One of the things we're already seeing on Twitch is multiplayer entertainment coming to sports.
115	So, Twitch and the NFL teamed up to offer livestreaming football, but instead of network announcers in suits streaming the game, we got Twitch users to come in and stream it themselves on their own channel and interact with their community and make it a real multiplayer experience.
116	So I actually think that if you look out into the future — only hundreds of people today get to be sports announcers.
117	It's a tiny, tiny number of people who have that opportunity.
118	But sports are about to go multiplayer, and that means that anyone who wants to around the world is going to get the opportunity to become a sports announcer, to give it a shot.
119	And I think that's going to unlock incredible amounts of new talent for all of us.
120	"And we're not going to be asking, ""Did you catch the game?"""
121	"Instead, we're going to be asking, ""Whose channel did you catch the game on?"""
122	We already see this happening with cooking, with singing — we even see people streaming welding.
123	And all of this stuff is going to happen around the metaphorical campfire.
124	There's going to be millions of these campfires lit over the next few years.
125	And on every topic, you're going to be able to find a campfire that will allow you to bond with your people around the world.
126	For most of human history, entertainment was simply multiplayer.
127	We sang together in person, we shared news together in the town square in person, and somewhere along the way, that two-way conversation turned into a one-way transmission.
128	As someone who cares about communities, I am excited for a world where our entertainment could connect us instead of isolating us.
129	A world where we can bond with each other over our shared interests and create real, strong communities.
130	Games, streams and the interactions they encourage, are only just beginning to turn the wheel back to our interactive, community-rich, multiplayer past.
131	Thank you all for sharing this experience here with me, and may you all find your best campfire.

1	I build telescopes because, number one, they are awesome.
2	But number two, I believe if you want to discover a new thing about the universe, you have to look at the universe in a new way.
3	New technologies in astronomy — things like lenses, photographic plates, all the way up to space telescopes — each gave us new ways to see the universe and directly led to a new understanding of our place in it.
4	But those discoveries come with a cost.
5	It took thousands of people and 44 years to get the Hubble Space Telescope from an idea into orbit.
6	It takes time, it takes a tolerance for failure, it takes individual people choosing every day not to give up.
7	I know how hard that choice is because I live it.
8	The reality of my job is that I fail almost all the time and still keep going, because that's how telescopes get built.
9	"The telescope I helped build is called the faint intergalactic-medium red-shifted emission balloon, which is a mouthful, so we call it ""FIREBall."""
10	And don't worry, it is not going to explode at the end of this story.
11	I've been working on FIREBall for more than 10 years and now lead the team of incredible people who built it.
12	FIREBall is designed to observe some of the faintest structures known: huge clouds of hydrogen gas.
13	These clouds are giant.
14	They are even bigger than whatever you're thinking of.
15	They are huge, huge clouds of hydrogen that we think flow into and out of galaxies.
16	I work on FIREBall because what I really want is to take our view of the universe from one with just light from stars to one where we can see and measure every atom that exists.
17	That's all that I want to do.
18	(Laughter)
19	But observing at least some of those atoms is crucial to our understanding of why galaxies look the way they do.
20	I want to know how that hydrogen gas gets into a galaxy and creates a star.
21	My work on FIREBall started in 2008, working not on the telescope but on the light sensor, which is the heart of any telescope.
22	This new sensor was being developed by a team that I joined at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
23	And our goal was to prove that this sensor would work really well to detect that hydrogen gas.
24	In my work on this, I destroyed several very, very, very expensive sensors before realizing that the machine I was using created a plasma that shorted out anything electrical that we put in it.
25	We used a different machine, there were other challenges, and it took years to get it right.
26	But when that first sensor worked, it was glorious.
27	And our sensors are now 10 times better than the previous state of the art and are getting put into all kinds of new telescopes.
28	Our sensors will give us a new way to see the universe and our place in it.
29	So, sensors done, time to build a telescope.
30	And FIREBall is weird as far as telescopes go, because it's not in space, and it's not on the ground.
31	Instead, it hangs on a cable from a giant balloon and observes for one night only from 130,000 feet in the stratosphere, at the very edge of space.
32	This is partly because the edge of space is much cheaper than actual space.
33	(Laughter)
34	So building it, of course, more failures: mirrors that failed, scratched mirrors that had to be remade; cooling system failures, an entire system that had to be remade; calibration failures, we ran tests again and again and again and again; failures when you literally least expect them: we had an adorable but super angry baby falcon that landed on our spectrograph tank one day.
35	(Laughter)
36	Although to be fair, this was the greatest day in the history of this project.
37	(Laughter)
38	I really loved that falcon.
39	But falcon damage fixed, we got it built for an August 2017 launch attempt — and then failed to launch, due to six weeks of continuous rain in the New Mexico desert.
40	(Laughter)
41	Our spirits dampened, we showed up again, August 2018, year 10.
42	And on the morning of September 22nd, we finally got the telescope launched.
43	(Applause)
44	I have put so much of myself — my whole life — into this project, and I, like, still can't believe that that happened.
45	And I have this picture that's taken right around sunset on that day of our balloon, FIREBall hanging from it, and the nearly full moon.
46	And I love this picture.
47	God, I love it.
48	But I look at it, and it makes me want to cry, because when fully inflated, these balloons are spherical, and this one isn't.
49	It's shaped like a teardrop.
50	And that's because there is a hole in it.
51	Sometimes balloons fail, too.
52	FIREBall crash-landed in the New Mexico desert, and we didn't get the data that we wanted.
53	"And at the end of that day, I thought to myself, ""Why am I doing this?"""
54	And I've thought a lot about why since that day.
55	And I've realized that all of my work has been full of things that break and fail, that we don't understand and they fail, that we just get wrong the first time, and so they fail.
56	I think about the thousands of people who built Hubble and how many failures they endured.
57	There were countless failures, heartbreaking failures, even when it was in space.
58	And none of those failures were a reason for them to give up.
59	I think about why I love my job.
60	I want to know what is happening in the universe.
61	You all want to know what's happening in the universe, too.
62	I want to know what's going on with that hydrogen.
63	And so I've realized that discovery is mostly a process of finding things that don't work, and failure is inevitable when you're pushing the limits of knowledge.
64	And that's what I want to do.
65	So I'm choosing to keep going.
66	And our team is going to do what everyone who has ever built anything before us has done: we're going to try again, in 2020.
67	And it might feel like a failure today — and it really does — but it's only going to stay a failure if I give up.
68	Thank you very much.
69	(Applause)
0	You don't know them.
1	You don't see them.
2	But they're always around, whispering, making secret plans, building armies with millions of soldiers.
3	And when they decide to attack, they all attack at the same time.
4	I'm talking about bacteria.
5	(Laughter)
6	Who did you think I was talking about?
7	Bacteria live in communities just like humans.
8	They have families, they talk, and they plan their activities.
9	And just like humans, they trick, deceive, and some might even cheat on each other.
10	What if I tell you that we can listen to bacterial conversations and translate their confidential information into human language?
11	And what if I tell you that translating bacterial conversations can save lives?
12	I hold a PhD in nanophysics, and I've used nanotechnology to develop a real-time translation tool that can spy on bacterial communities and give us recordings of what bacteria are up to.
13	Bacteria live everywhere.
14	They're in the soil, on our furniture and inside our bodies.
15	In fact, 90 percent of all the live cells in this theater are bacterial.
16	Some bacteria are good for us; they help us digest food or produce antibiotics.
17	And some bacteria are bad for us; they cause diseases and death.
18	To coordinate all the functions bacteria have, they have to be able to organize, and they do that just like us humans — by communicating.
19	But instead of using words, they use signaling molecules to communicate with each other.
20	When bacteria are few, the signaling molecules just flow away, like the screams of a man alone in the desert.
21	But when there are many bacteria, the signaling molecules accumulate, and the bacteria start sensing that they're not alone.
22	They listen to each other.
23	In this way, they keep track of how many they are and when they're many enough to initiate a new action.
24	And when the signaling molecules have reached a certain threshold, all the bacteria sense at once that they need to act with the same action.
25	So bacterial conversation consists of an initiative and a reaction, a production of a molecule and the response to it.
26	In my research, I focused on spying on bacterial communities inside the human body.
27	How does it work?
28	We have a sample from a patient.
29	It could be a blood or spit sample.
30	We shoot electrons into the sample, the electrons will interact with any communication molecules present, and this interaction will give us information on the identity of the bacteria, the type of communication and how much the bacteria are talking.
31	But what is it like when bacteria communicate?
32	Before I developed the translation tool, my first assumption was that bacteria would have a primitive language, like infants that haven't developed words and sentences yet.
33	When they laugh, they're happy; when they cry, they're sad.
34	Simple as that.
35	But bacteria turned out to be nowhere as primitive as I thought they would be.
36	A molecule is not just a molecule.
37	It can mean different things depending on the context, just like the crying of babies can mean different things: sometimes the baby is hungry, sometimes it's wet, sometimes it's hurt or afraid.
38	Parents know how to decode those cries.
39	And to be a real translation tool, it had to be able to decode the signaling molecules and translate them depending on the context.
40	And who knows?
41	Maybe Google Translate will adopt this soon.
42	(Laughter)
43	Let me give you an example.
44	I've brought some bacterial data that can be a bit tricky to understand if you're not trained, but try to take a look.
45	(Laughter)
46	Here's a happy bacterial family that has infected a patient.
47	Let's call them the Montague family.
48	They share resources, they reproduce, and they grow.
49	One day, they get a new neighbor, bacterial family Capulet.
50	(Laughter)
51	Everything is fine, as long as they're working together.
52	But then something unplanned happens.
53	Romeo from Montague has a relationship with Juliet from Capulet.
54	(Laughter)
55	And yes, they share genetic material.
56	(Laughter)
57	Now, this gene transfer can be dangerous to the Montagues that have the ambition to be the only family in the patient they have infected, and sharing genes contributes to the Capulets developing resistance to antibiotics.
58	So the Montagues start talking internally to get rid of this other family by releasing this molecule.
59	(Laughter)
60	And with subtitles:
61	[Let us coordinate an attack.]
62	(Laughter)
63	Let's coordinate an attack.
64	And then everybody at once responds by releasing a poison that will kill the other family.
65	[Eliminate!]
66	(Laughter)
67	The Capulets respond by calling for a counterattack.
68	[Counterattack!]
69	And they have a battle.
70	This is a video of real bacteria dueling with swordlike organelles, where they try to kill each other by literally stabbing and rupturing each other.
71	Whoever's family wins this battle becomes the dominant bacteria.
72	So what I can do is to detect bacterial conversations that lead to different collective behaviors like the fight you just saw.
73	And what I did was to spy on bacterial communities inside the human body in patients at a hospital.
74	I followed 62 patients in an experiment, where I tested the patient samples for one particular infection, without knowing the results of the traditional diagnostic test.
75	Now, in bacterial diagnostics, a sample is smeared out on a plate, and if the bacteria grow within five days, the patient is diagnosed as infected.
76	When I finished the study and I compared the tool results to the traditional diagnostic test and the validation test, I was shocked.
77	It was far more astonishing than I had ever anticipated.
78	But before I tell you what the tool revealed, I would like to tell you about a specific patient I followed, a young girl.
79	She had cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that made her lungs susceptible to bacterial infections.
80	This girl wasn't a part of the clinical trial.
81	I followed her because I knew from her medical record that she had never had an infection before.
82	Once a month, this girl went to the hospital to cough up a sputum sample that she spit in a cup.
83	This sample was transferred for bacterial analysis at the central laboratory so the doctors could act quickly if they discovered an infection.
84	And it allowed me to test my device on her samples as well.
85	The first two months I measured on her samples, there was nothing.
86	But the third month, I discovered some bacterial chatter in her sample.
87	The bacteria were coordinating to damage her lung tissue.
88	But the traditional diagnostics showed no bacteria at all.
89	I measured again the next month, and I could see that the bacterial conversations became even more aggressive.
90	Still, the traditional diagnostics showed nothing.
91	My study ended, but a half a year later, I followed up on her status to see if the bacteria only I knew about had disappeared without medical intervention.
92	They hadn't.
93	But the girl was now diagnosed with a severe infection of deadly bacteria.
94	It was the very same bacteria my tool discovered earlier.
95	And despite aggressive antibiotic treatment, it was impossible to eradicate the infection.
96	Doctors deemed that she would not survive her 20s.
97	When I measured on this girl's samples, my tool was still in the initial stage.
98	I didn't even know if my method worked at all, therefore I had an agreement with the doctors not to tell them what my tool revealed in order not to compromise their treatment.
99	So when I saw these results that weren't even validated, I didn't dare to tell because treating a patient without an actual infection also has negative consequences for the patient.
100	But now we know better, and there are many young boys and girls that still can be saved because, unfortunately, this scenario happens very often.
101	Patients get infected, the bacteria somehow don't show on the traditional diagnostic test, and suddenly, the infection breaks out in the patient with severe symptoms.
102	And at that point, it's already too late.
103	The surprising result of the 62 patients I followed was that my device caught bacterial conversations in more than half of the patient samples that were diagnosed as negative by traditional methods.
104	In other words, more than half of these patients went home thinking they were free from infection, although they actually carried dangerous bacteria.
105	Inside these wrongly diagnosed patients, bacteria were coordinating a synchronized attack.
106	They were whispering to each other.
107	"What I call ""whispering bacteria"" are bacteria that traditional methods cannot diagnose."
108	So far, it's only the translation tool that can catch those whispers.
109	I believe that the time frame in which bacteria are still whispering is a window of opportunity for targeted treatment.
110	If the girl had been treated during this window of opportunity, it might have been possible to kill the bacteria in their initial stage, before the infection got out of hand.
111	What I experienced with this young girl made me decide to do everything I can to push this technology into the hospital.
112	Together with doctors, I'm already working on implementing this tool in clinics to diagnose early infections.
113	Although it's still not known how doctors should treat patients during the whispering phase, this tool can help doctors keep a closer eye on patients in risk.
114	It could help them confirm if a treatment had worked or not, and it could help answer simple questions: Is the patient infected?
115	And what are the bacteria up to?
116	Bacteria talk, they make secret plans, and they send confidential information to each other.
117	But not only can we catch them whispering, we can all learn their secret language and become ourselves bacterial whisperers.
118	"And, as bacteria would say, ""3-oxo-C12-aniline."""
119	(Laughter)
120	(Applause)
121	Thank you.
0	My name is Glenn, I'm 25, and I don't know my real last name.
1	It's not uncommon in America.
2	Most black people in this country are walking around with a slave owner's last name.
3	Black history has been systemically erased and altered for centuries.
4	As I give this talk, there are more than 700 Confederate monuments standing nationwide.
5	These were erected to honor Confederate soldiers who fought to maintain slavery — mostly in the South — from the 1890s to the 1950s, when Jim Crow laws enforcing racial segregation were in full effect.
6	To this day, black people are forced to confront monuments of slaveholders in our public spaces.
7	These memorials are a physical representation of a system that is actively working to define whose lives matter and whose lives do not.
8	If we are going to disrupt the narrative, we have to start at the origin.
9	Genocide, slavery and patriarchy started in the Americas with Christopher Columbus.
10	Most people in the United States know about his voyage of 1492.
11	Fewer people know that an estimated 250,000 indigenous Arawaks were wiped out within two years of his arrival.
12	"Even fewer people know that Columbus admitted in a letter written to Doña Juana de la Torre that ""nine and 10-year-old girls were in high demand, and for girls of all ages a good price must be paid."""
13	Yet New York City's Columbus Circle has had him perched 76 feet high next to Central Park since 1892.
14	I started Movers and Shakers, a nonprofit, to get the statue removed.
15	Movers and Shakers is a group of activists, artists, educators and engineers focused on using immersive technology to highlight the narratives of the oppressed.
16	In our campaign to knock Columbus off his pedestal, we engaged in a visually provocative form of activism.
17	We created an augmented reality installation on the true story of Christopher Columbus and used it to host teach-ins in Columbus Circle and Times Square.
18	Many see the controversy around the statue as tension between the Italian-American community and the indigenous community.
19	The reality is that most black people are here in this country as a result of the atrocities that were kicked off by Christopher Columbus.
20	So we ended up holding a slave auction in Union Square to tie into the genesis of the transatlantic slave trade.
21	I ran the New York City Marathon in chains to spread awareness to this issue.
22	I was also arrested in Giants Stadium for hosting a slave reenactment at their football team's home opener.
23	We gave it everything that we had, but in the end, New York City decided to keep the statue, and New York State unanimously voted to make it a landmark.
24	The news was devastating, but it opened up another door.
25	We realized that with augmented reality you don't need permission from the government to put up a monument or to make a statement.
26	You can just do it.
27	So New York City right now currently has more than 150 statues of men and six of women and currently acknowledges slaveholders in public spaces as well.
28	So we decided, why not just put up a bunch of AR monuments of women and people of color throughout the city?
29	Typically, monuments are created to commemorate the achievements of the deceased, but with augmented reality, we can reroute the rules.
30	We started with sports.
31	Colin Kaepernick.
32	He was the starting quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, and he wanted to use his platform to highlight the injustice of systemic racism.
33	So he consulted a Green Beret on the most respectful way to do this, and he decided to take a knee during the national anthem.
34	He lost his contract with the 49ers, he was blackballed by every NFL owner, he was criticized by millions and even the president of the United States decided to insult him.
35	It may be decades before Colin Kaepernick is adequately respected for his courage, so our team decided to do this.
36	Now anyone that walks by Trump Tower can see Colin Kaepernick take a knee in augmented reality, and there's nothing they can do about it.
37	(Laughter)
38	Representation matters.
39	Serena Williams proved to the world that a black girl from Compton can dominate a sport that's traditionally played at exclusive country clubs.
40	Let's celebrate her now.
41	Jackie Robinson.
42	He broke the color barrier and empowered many black athletes to play in Major League Baseball.
43	We're going to take this monument of him and put it in Ebbets Field so that anyone can see him swing for the fences in Ebbets Field in Brooklyn.
44	With augmented reality, we have the power to tell stories in public spaces that need to be told.
45	The achievements of people like Frida Kahlo, Audre Lorde, Toussaint Louverture, Madam C.J.
46	Walker — this should be common knowledge.
47	"Our vision is a ""Pokémon Go"" for a contextualized history."
48	Augmented reality can also be used as a tool to support organizations that are fighting against systemic oppression.
49	In 2019 we will release our free smartphone app with augmented reality monuments and content.
50	You can take your smartphone and hold it over any one-dollar bill and see a scene in augmented reality that illustrates the injustice of cash bail.
51	You can then click on the screen and be directed to the donation page of The Bail Project, a fund that raises money for people who cannot afford bail.
52	With augmented reality, we the people have the power to highlight the narratives of the oppressed when institutions refuse to do so.
53	We can use this tool to highlight the systemic implications of erasing someone's history.
54	And more concretely, we can use this technology as a way to support initiatives that are fighting against systemic racism.
55	With AR, we have the power to reimagine a world that prioritizes justice over oppression.
56	Thank you.
57	(Applause and cheers)
0	I have a question for you.
1	Anybody in the audience who doesn't have a plastic ID?
2	Anybody?
3	Well, think about it.
4	Plastic is everywhere.
5	The buttons on your shirt, your mobile cover, the water from the plastic bottle you just had, plastic money in the wallet, maybe.
6	It is interesting how plastic has become an integral part of our lives and how we cannot go one single day without it.
7	Do you know what that makes me think?
8	How my generation is inheriting not just this legacy but also the problem that comes with it: the problem of what we throw in our oceans.
9	Hello, everybody.
10	My name is Haaziq Kazi.
11	I am 12 years old, and I alone have a plastic debt of roughly 66 tons and counting.
12	So, in case you are wondering, What is plastic debt?
13	It is the amount of non-cycled plastic which we humans leave behind on this planet.
14	How many Indians in the house today?
15	Raise your hands, please.
16	According to a study, for every person in India, six tons of plastic is not recycled annually.
17	Any Americans here?
18	Your figures are even more astounding.
19	Ninety tons per person of plastic which is not recycled, annually.
20	Imagine, in a lifetime, how much plastic is left behind because of us.
21	When we die, our bodies go back to Mother Earth, but the plastic debt is left behind as a legacy for the coming generations.
22	Did you know that by 2050, we will have as much, or maybe more, plastic in the ocean than fish?
23	"Speaking of which, every time I see people eating fish, I wonder, ""Are they eating fish or plastic?"""
24	Because the plastic we dispose that ends up in the ocean might have been consumed by the same fish which gets on our plate - talk about the vicious karmic cycle.
25	The magnitude of the problem inspired me to do something about this.
26	Hence, I came up with an idea of an invention that could help make the oceans a cleaner place: an ocean cleaner called ERVIS.
27	ERVIS is an intelligent ship which sucks waste from the ocean surface and cleans it.
28	It all started two years back.
29	I saw some documentaries and a TED Talk of Boyan Slat about how he wanted to clean the oceans.
30	A few days later, as I came home from playing football, my mom asked me to wash my hands, and as I went to the sink to get the dirt off, I observed a whirlpool of water going down the drain.
31	An idea came to my mind, and I smiled.
32	I drew and created a rough model, a circular ship with saucers attached, a very futuristic design, much like the USS Enterprise from Star Trek.
33	Come on, we all love the series.
34	Right?
35	This was just the first draft.
36	The propellers weren't automated, and it only lasted seven seconds in water before coming apart.
37	But there it was: my ERVIS, my vision of changing the oceans.
38	While guzzling down innumerable cups of hot chocolate - you know, I'm still a kid, no coffee for me - I did some exhaustive research to achieve my vision of ERVIS, which is: first, to clean the current waste floating in the ocean; second, to analyze the data from the waste which we collect; and third, to stop it at source, which is getting disposed by the ships.
39	I also realized that a circular shape was not very efficient and that I had to redesign my ship to be more hydrodynamic.
40	So I worked with scientists and engineers to create a more bleeding edge model.
41	So here's how it works.
42	The ship is essentially a large boat powered by solar and renewable natural gas, with various compartments, and saucers surrounding it.
43	The saucers float on the surface, gravitate to create a whirlpool to pull the waste towards its center, which is then sent through a tube to various chambers in the ship.
44	The chambers include an oil chamber, which collects waste oil.
45	The next four chambers are for large, medium, small, and micro-waste, respectively.
46	Just imagine ERVIS to be a gigantic vacuum cleaner with many cleaning tubes attached to many dust bags.
47	Once the waste enters the chambers, ERVIS analyzes, segregates, and compacts it, and pumps the filtered water back into the oceans, all without harming marine life in the process.
48	ERVIS, the ship, is my contribution in making the Earth a better place.
49	(Applause) And I hope, in some way, it can inspire you to find your idea which can bring a positive change in the world.
50	Thank you.
51	(Applause) (Cheers)
0	Hello.
1	My name is Herman, and I've always been struck by how the most important, impactful, tsunami-like changes to our culture and our society always come from those things that we least think are going to have that impact.
2	I mean, as a computer scientist, I remember when Facebook was just image-sharing in dorm rooms, and depending upon who you ask, it's now involved in toppling elections.
3	I remember when cryptocurrency or automated trading were sort of ideas by a few renegades in the financial institutions in the world for automated trading, or online, for cryptocurrency, and they're now coming to quickly shape the way that we operate.
4	And I think each of you can recall that moment where one of these ideas felt like some ignorable, derisive thing, and suddenly, oh, crap, the price of Bitcoin is what it is.
5	Or, oh, crap, guess who's been elected.
6	The reality is that, you know, from my perspective, I think that we're about to encounter that again.
7	And I think one of the biggest, most impactful changes in the way we live our lives, to the ways we're educated, probably even to how we end up making an income, is about to come not from AI, not from space travel or biotech — these are all very important future inventions — but in the next five years, I think it's going to come from video games.
8	So that's a bold claim, OK.
9	I see some skeptical faces in the audience.
10	But if we take a moment to try to look at what video games are already becoming in our lives today, and what just a little bit of technological advancement is about to create, it starts to become more of an inevitability.
11	And I think the possibilities are quite electrifying.
12	So let's just take a moment to think about scale.
13	I mean, there's already 2.6 billion people who play games.
14	And the reality is that's a billion more than five years ago.
15	A billion more people in that time.
16	No religion, no media, nothing has spread like that.
17	And there's likely to be a billion more when Africa and India gain the infrastructure to sort of fully realize the possibilities of gaming.
18	But what I find really special is — and this often shocks a lot of people — is that the average age of a gamer, like, have a guess, think about it.
19	It's not six, it's not 18, it's not 12.
20	It's 34.
21	[Average age of an American gamer] It's older than me.
22	And that tells us something, that this isn't entertainment for children anymore.
23	This is already a medium like literature or anything else that's becoming a fundamental part of our lives.
24	One stat I like is that people who generally picked up gaming in the last sort of 15, 20 years generally don't stop.
25	Something changed in the way that this medium is organized.
26	And more than that, it's not just play anymore, right?
27	You've heard some examples today, but people are earning an income playing games.
28	And not in the obvious ways.
29	Yes, there's e-sports, there's prizes, there's the opportunity to make money in a competitive way.
30	But there's also people earning incomes modding games, building content in them, doing art in them.
31	I mean, there's something at a scale akin to the Florentine Renaissance, happening on your kid's iPhone in your living room.
32	And it's being ignored.
33	Now, what's even more exciting for me is what's about to happen.
34	And when you think about gaming, you're probably already imagining that it features these massive, infinite worlds, but the truth is, games have been deeply limited for a very long time in a way that kind of we in the industry have tried very hard to cover up with as much trickery as possible.
35	The metaphor I like to use, if you'd let me geek out for a moment, is the notion of a theater.
36	For the last 10 years, games have massively advanced the visual effects, the physical immersion, the front end of games.
37	But behind the scenes, the actual experiential reality of a game world has remained woefully limited.
38	I'll put that in perspective for a moment.
39	I could leave this theater right now, I could do some graffiti, get in a fight, fall in love.
40	I might actually do all of those things after this, but the point is that all of that would have consequence.
41	It would ripple through reality — all of you could interact with that at the same time.
42	It would be persistent.
43	And those are very important qualities to what makes the real world real.
44	Now, behind the scenes in games, we've had a limit for a very long time.
45	And the limit is, behind the visuals, the actual information being exchanged between players or entities in a single game world has been deeply bounded by the fact that games mostly take place on a single server or a single machine.
46	Even The World of Warcraft is actually thousands of smaller worlds.
47	When you hear about concerts in Fortnite, you're actually hearing about thousands of small concerts.
48	You know, individual, as was said earlier today, campfires or couches.
49	There isn't really this possibility to bring it all together.
50	Let's take a moment to just really understand what that means.
51	When you look at a game, you might see this, beautiful visuals, all of these things happening in front of you.
52	But behind the scenes in an online game, this is what it looks like.
53	To a computer scientist, all you see is just a little bit of information being exchanged by a tiny handful of meaningful entities or objects.
54	"You might be thinking, ""I've played in an infinite world."""
55	Well it's more that you've played on a treadmill.
56	As you've been walking through that world, we've been cleverly causing the parts of it that you're not in to vanish, and the parts of it in front of you to appear.
57	A good trick, but not the basis for the revolution that I promised you in the beginning of this talk.
58	But the reality is, for those of you that are passionate gamers and might be excited about this, and for those of you that are afraid and may not be, all of that is about to change.
59	Because finally, the technology is in place to go well beyond the limits that we've previously seen.
60	I've dedicated my career to this, there are many others working on the problem — I'd hardly take credit for it myself, but we're at the point now where we can finally do this impossible hard thing of weaving together thousands of disparate machines into single simulations that are convenient enough to not be one-offs, but to be buildable by anybody.
61	And to be at the point where we can start to experience those things that we can't yet fathom.
62	Let's just take a moment to visualize that.
63	I'm talking about not individual little simulations but a massive possibility of huge networks of interaction.
64	Massive global events that can happen inside that.
65	Things that even in the real world become challenging to produce at that kind of scale.
66	And I know some of you are gamers, so I'm going to show you some footage of some things that I'm pretty sure I'm allowed to do, from some of our partners.
67	TED and me had a back-and-forth on this.
68	These are a few things that not many people have seen before, some new experiences powered by this type of technology.
69	I'll just [take] a moment to show you some of this stuff.
70	This is a single game world with thousands of simultaneous people participating in a conflict.
71	It also has its own ecosystem, its own sense of predator and prey.
72	Every single object you see here is simulated in some way.
73	This is a game being built by one of the biggest companies in the world, NetEase, a huge Chinese company.
74	And they've made an assistant creative simulation where groups of players can cocreate together, across multiple devices, in a world that doesn't vanish when you're done.
75	It's a place to tell stories and have adventures.
76	Even the weather is simulated.
77	And that's kind of awesome.
78	And this is my personal favorite.
79	This is a group of people, pioneers in Berlin, a group called Klang Games, and they're completely insane, and they'll love me for saying that.
80	And they found a way to model, basically, an entire planet.
81	They're going to have a simulation with millions of non-player characters and players engaging.
82	They actually grabbed Lawrence Lessig to help understand the political ramifications of the world they're creating.
83	This is the sort of astounding set of experiences, well beyond what we might have imagined, that are now going to be possible.
84	And that's just the first step in this technology.
85	So if we step beyond that, what happens?
86	Well, computer science tends to be all exponential, once we crack the really hard problems.
87	And I'm pretty sure that very soon, we're going to be in a place where we can make this type of computational power look like nothing.
88	And when that happens, the opportunities ...
89	It's worth taking a moment to try to imagine what I'm talking about here.
90	Hundreds of thousands or millions of people being able to coinhabit the same space.
91	The last time any of us as a species had the opportunity to build or do something together with that may people was in antiquity.
92	And the circumstances were less than optimal, shall we say.
93	Mostly conflicts or building pyramids.
94	Not necessarily the best thing for us to be spending our time doing.
95	But if you bring together that many people, the kind of shared experience that can create ...
96	I think it exercises a social muscle in us that we've lost and forgotten.
97	Going even beyond that, I want to take a moment to think about what it means for relationships, for identity.
98	If we can give each other worlds, experiences at scale where we can spend a meaningful amount of our time, we can change what it means to be an individual.
99	We can go beyond a single identity to a diverse set of personal identities.
100	The gender, the race, the personality traits you were born with might be something you want to experiment differently with.
101	You might be someone that wants to be more than one person.
102	We all are, inside, multiple people.
103	We rarely get the opportunity to flex that.
104	It's also about empathy.
105	I have a grandmother who I have literally nothing in common with.
106	I love her to bits, but every story she has begins in 1940 and ends sometime in 1950.
107	And every story I have is like 50 years later.
108	But if we could coinhabit, co-experience things together, that undiminished by physical frailty or by lack of context, create opportunities together, that changes things, that bonds people in different ways.
109	I'm struck by how social media has amplified our many differences, and really made us more who we are in the presence of other people.
110	I think games could really start to create an opportunity for us to empathize again.
111	To have shared adversity, shared opportunity.
112	I mean, statistically, at this moment in time, there are people who are on the opposite sides of a conflict, who have been matchmade together into a game and don't even know it.
113	That's an incredible opportunity to change the way we look at things.
114	Finally, for those of you who perhaps are more cynical about all of this, who maybe don't think that virtual worlds and games are your cup of tea.
115	There's a reality you have to accept, and that is that the economic impact of what I'm talking about will be profound.
116	Right now, thousands of people have full-time jobs in gaming.
117	Soon, it will be millions of people.
118	Wherever there's a mobile phone, there will be a job.
119	An opportunity for something that is creative and rich and gives you an income, no matter what country you're in, no matter what skills or opportunities you might think you have.
120	Probably the first dollar most kids born today make might be in a game.
121	That will be the new paper route, that will be the new opportunity for an income at the earliest time in your life.
122	So I kind of want to end with almost a plea, really, more than thoughts.
123	A sense of, I think, how we need to face this new opportunity a little differently to some we have in the past.
124	"It's so hypocritical for yet another technologist to stand up on stage and say, ""The future will be great, technology will fix it."""
125	And the reality is, this is going to have downsides.
126	But those downsides will only be amplified if we approach, once again, with cynicism and derision, the opportunities that this presents.
127	The worst thing that we could possibly do is let the same four or five companies end up dominating yet another adjacent space.
128	(Applause)
129	Because they're not just going to define how and who makes money from this.
130	The reality is, we're now talking about defining how we think, what the rules are around identity and collaboration, the rules of the world we live in.
131	This has got to be something we all own, we all cocreate.
132	So, my final plea is really to those engineers, those scientists, those artists in the audience today.
133	Maybe some of you dreamed of working on space travel.
134	The reality is, there are worlds you can build right here, right now, that can transform people's lives.
135	There are still huge technological frontiers that need to be overcome here, akin to those we faced when building the early internet.
136	All the technology behind virtual worlds is different.
137	So, my plea to you is this.
138	Let's engage, let's all engage, let's actually try to make this something that we shape in a positive way, rather than once again have be done to us.
139	Thank you.
140	(Applause)
0	Computers have become truly incredible.
1	We are walking around with supercomputers in our pocket.
2	How amazing is that?
3	So it is disappointing that the way we use computers, the way we interact with them, hasn't really changed in the last 50 years.
4	We still use a mouse and keyboards.
5	We're clicking on screens and buttons.
6	Mobile phones are the same.
7	We're just using fingers instead of a mouse.
8	So is that it?
9	Is that what the future looks like?
10	We're going to be stuck in the screens with our faces not seeing the world around us?
11	That's not the future I imagine, or the future I'm attracted to.
12	What I've been always interested in is things, physical things we use every day, like things on this table that the family doesn't pay attention to.
13	Things tell our story.
14	They tell who we are.
15	They tell a lot about us.
16	Let me give you an example.
17	These are photographs of things a person touched during 24 hours.
18	What can you tell about him?
19	He loves his motorcycle.
20	Right?
21	The biggest thing in his picture.
22	What can you tell about this girl?
23	She spends all her time on the beach.
24	There's a surfboard.
25	She lives by the sea.
26	What can you tell about this guy?
27	He's a chef.
28	Look at all the ingredients he touched during the day, while he was preparing the food, and the computer is a tiny part of his life, this sad thing in the corner.
29	So if we are using things all the time, and this is a big part of our lives, can things become the way for us to interact with our digital life?
30	Can the world become your interface?
31	That was my idea.
32	I've been working for 20 years on it.
33	My idea is that in order to interact in digital life, you don't need to have screens and keyboards and mouses.
34	You can interact with your digital life just by using the things you use every day.
35	And to realize this idea, I need to solve three big challenges.
36	Let me tell you about them.
37	The first one, obviously: Is it even possible?
38	How can you take an everyday thing you use every day and turn it into a computer interface?
39	"Now I was inspired by the book ""Hackers."""
40	I read it when I was a teenager, and one of the essential ideas of this book is that you can change the purpose of things by inventing new technology and then hacking into things and changing them.
41	So I've been thinking what kind of technology I can invent so that I can hack into things you use every day and make them interactive.
42	So when I was working on this thing, I invented this sensor which injects structured electric fields into objects and turns them into gesture interfaces.
43	So this doorknob, unmodified, can become a gesture sensor.
44	It can know how you're touching it.
45	It can feel how you're touching it.
46	It makes a circle, or can I grasp.
47	And this doorknob isn't modified.
48	There's nothing special about doorknobs.
49	Anything can become interactive.
50	What about plants?
51	So plants are interesting, because with plants, they can know where you're touching.
52	You can see the line moving up and down on the image.
53	And that can turn into a musical interface.
54	(Musical tones)
55	Now, we do have also practical applications: a calendar plant for those who are obsessed about practicality.
56	(Laughter)
57	We can give things a personality.
58	(Low notes changing in pitch)
59	So in this particular example, the orchid can communicate to you through images and sounds.
60	It doesn't like to be touched, so it's created these electric images that are hissing at you.
61	This plant, for example, is more robust, it's a snake plant, and it likes playing with you.
62	It engages you.
63	So every thing can be different, and every thing can represent what it feels.
64	So everything can be hacked, all the things, including your body.
65	In this example, we hacked your body so you can measure how you're folding your hands and then using your hand gestures to control something else, so if you don't want to listen to some music thousands of times, you simply can cover your ears to turn it off.
66	So everything can be hacked, and research is important, but the second challenge we have is how can we go from R and D, and prototypes, to real products?
67	How can we make real things that are also interfaces?
68	And you may ask yourself, who would do this?
69	Silicon Valley?
70	Is it through Shenzhen?
71	Now the challenge there is that the world of things is huge.
72	Every year, the apparel industry produces 150 billion garments.
73	In comparison, the technology industry only makes 1.4 billion phones.
74	The world of things is much bigger than the world of technology.
75	The technology world cannot change the world of things.
76	Instead, we need to create technology which changes makers of things, people who make your chairs and clothes and everything else, into makers of smart things, enable them to do that.
77	So to test this challenge, we came up with a very simple idea and challenge: Can a tailor make a wearable?
78	Now we don't want to take a tailor and turn the tailor into an electrical engineer.
79	We still want to have some tailors around.
80	But what we would like to do is create technology which looks, feels and behaves like a raw material used by the tailor to make their clothes.
81	For example, a touch panel made for a tailor would look like this, made out of textiles, so you can cut it with scissors and sew it in.
82	At the same time, it has to retain the performance.
83	The way to make this textile touch panel also requires a very different approach than for making consumer electronics.
84	In our case, we have to go to the mountains of Tokyo to a small factory which was making kimono garments for generations.
85	We worked with my collaborators, who were not engineers.
86	It was an artisan who knows how to make things and an artist who knows how to make things beautiful.
87	Working with them, we created one of the best yarns in the world, which consists of thin metallic alloys wrapped around with polyester fibers and cotton fibers.
88	These yarns were made in the same machines which were making yarns for kimonos for generations.
89	We then took these yarns and gave them to the factory, which is making textiles, and we wove our smart textile using regular machines in a variety of colors and materials, and we gave those textiles to a tailor in Savile Row in London.
90	So tailors are traditionalists, particularly in Savile Row.
91	They don't use computers.
92	They don't use machines.
93	They use hands and they cut.
94	They fit their products on the human body, not on 3-D avatars.
95	Technology is not a part of their vocabulary, but they are modern people.
96	They know how to use technology.
97	So if technology can be formed and shaped like a button, like a textile, like something they can use, they absolutely can make a wearable, a garment which can place a phone call.
98	(Phone rings)
99	So now we've proven that you can actually make a wearable, not by an electronic company, but by a tailor.
100	We worked and collaborated with Levi's, our partners and our neighbors, to make a real product, and this product is this jacket I'm wearing right now.
101	You can buy it.
102	It's on sale.
103	It was made in the same factories which make all their products, and you have noticed I've been controlling my presentation from the sleeve of the jacket.
104	I go like this, it goes forward.
105	Like this, it goes backward.
106	And of course, I can do more things.
107	It's not just to control a presentation.
108	I can now control my navigation, control my music, but most importantly, it stays a jacket, it stays a thing, which makes me look great.
109	(Laughter)
110	(Applause)
111	And that's the most important thing.
112	(Laughter)
113	So OK, we proved we can turn things into interfaces.
114	We proved that these things can be made by makers of things and not by technology companies.
115	I look awesome.
116	Are we done?
117	(Laughter)
118	Not yet.
119	The third challenge: How can we scale?
120	How can we go from one product to many products?
121	And that's what we're working on right now.
122	Let me tell you how we're going to do this.
123	First of all, I want to make myself clear — I am not talking about the Internet of Things.
124	I'm not talking about creating another gadget you get bored with and throw in the back of your drawer and forget about.
125	"I am talking about the foundational, important principle which guides my work: ""Technology has to make existing things better."""
126	It makes them better by connecting them to your digital life and adds new usefulness and new functionality while remaining the same original purpose, not changing it.
127	This jacket I am wearing can control my mobile phone and presentation, but it still remains a jacket.
128	That means that once we start making all things interactive and connected, every thing would have its own set of actuators, displays and sensors specific for those things.
129	A pair of running shoes does not need to have a touch sensor.
130	Why would it have one?
131	If you have a sensor, it should measure your running performance or knee impact, while remaining a great pair of shoes.
132	Makers of things will have to start thinking what kind of digital functionality they have to offer to their consumers.
133	They will have to become service providers, or they may become irrelevant.
134	We will have to provide and create a service ecosystem just like we've done for mobile phones, where you have apps and services and everything else, and sometimes, you're still making a phone call.
135	Now to make this ecosystem possible, we have to avoid fragmentation.
136	We have to avoid different interfaces for different people for different things.
137	We have to create uniform user experience and, for that reason, we have to create a single computing platform which powers all those things.
138	What is the platform going to be?
139	And I think the answer is obvious: it's a cloud, cloud computing.
140	Now you cannot connect things directly to the cloud, obviously.
141	So you have to develop a small device which can be plugged into all the things and make them connected to the cloud to unlock their potential and add new functionality.
142	So let me show, for the first time, the real device which we've built.
143	We are showing this for the first time.
144	That's what it looks like, and it's a small device which will be connected to things we want to make smart and connected and interactive.
145	How is it going to work?
146	So on the back, you have a few electrodes.
147	So when you plug them into different things, like here, the device will recognize where you're plugging them and then reconfigure itself to enable specific functionality for this particular thing.
148	We would like to give this device to makers of things, the people who make your clothing and furniture, so they can use it just like they use a button or a zipper.
149	And what they're going to make with them is up to them.
150	We don't want to dictate the use cases.
151	We would like to let people who make those things — artists and designers, brands and craftsmen — to imagine and create this new world where things are connected and have all this new, exciting digital functionality.
152	We don't need keyboards and screens and mouses to interact with your computer.
153	So I've been working on this idea for 20 years, and now it's taking shape, and as it's taking shape, what we are realizing is that I always thought I was working on computer interfaces, I always thought of myself as an interaction designer, but I'm realizing that I'm not building interfaces.
154	What I realized is that me and my team, we're building a new kind of computer, an ambient computer.
155	Thank you.
156	(Applause)
0	Chris Anderson: What worries you right now?
1	You've been very open about lots of issues on Twitter.
2	What would be your top worry about where things are right now?
3	Jack Dorsey: Right now, the health of the conversation.
4	So, our purpose is to serve the public conversation, and we have seen a number of attacks on it.
5	We've seen abuse, we've seen harassment, we've seen manipulation, automation, human coordination, misinformation.
6	So these are all dynamics that we were not expecting 13 years ago when we were starting the company.
7	But we do now see them at scale, and what worries me most is just our ability to address it in a systemic way that is scalable, that has a rigorous understanding of how we're taking action, a transparent understanding of how we're taking action and a rigorous appeals process for when we're wrong, because we will be wrong.
8	Whitney Pennington Rodgers: I'm really glad to hear that that's something that concerns you, because I think there's been a lot written about people who feel they've been abused and harassed on Twitter, and I think no one more so than women and women of color and black women.
9	And there's been data that's come out — Amnesty International put out a report a few months ago where they showed that a subset of active black female Twitter users were receiving, on average, one in 10 of their tweets were some form of harassment.
10	"And so when you think about health for the community on Twitter, I'm interested to hear, ""health for everyone,"" but specifically: How are you looking to make Twitter a safe space for that subset, for women, for women of color and black women?"
11	JD: Yeah.
12	So it's a pretty terrible situation when you're coming to a service that, ideally, you want to learn something about the world, and you spend the majority of your time reporting abuse, receiving abuse, receiving harassment.
13	So what we're looking most deeply at is just the incentives that the platform naturally provides and the service provides.
14	Right now, the dynamic of the system makes it super-easy to harass and to abuse others through the service, and unfortunately, the majority of our system in the past worked entirely based on people reporting harassment and abuse.
15	So about midway last year, we decided that we were going to apply a lot more machine learning, a lot more deep learning to the problem, and try to be a lot more proactive around where abuse is happening, so that we can take the burden off the victim completely.
16	And we've made some progress recently.
17	About 38 percent of abusive tweets are now proactively identified by machine learning algorithms so that people don't actually have to report them.
18	But those that are identified are still reviewed by humans, so we do not take down content or accounts without a human actually reviewing it.
19	But that was from zero percent just a year ago.
20	So that meant, at that zero percent, every single person who received abuse had to actually report it, which was a lot of work for them, a lot of work for us and just ultimately unfair.
21	The other thing that we're doing is making sure that we, as a company, have representation of all the communities that we're trying to serve.
22	We can't build a business that is successful unless we have a diversity of perspective inside of our walls that actually feel these issues every single day.
23	And that's not just with the team that's doing the work, it's also within our leadership as well.
24	So we need to continue to build empathy for what people are experiencing and give them better tools to act on it and also give our customers a much better and easier approach to handle some of the things that they're seeing.
25	So a lot of what we're doing is around technology, but we're also looking at the incentives on the service: What does Twitter incentivize you to do when you first open it up?
26	And in the past, it's incented a lot of outrage, it's incented a lot of mob behavior, it's incented a lot of group harassment.
27	And we have to look a lot deeper at some of the fundamentals of what the service is doing to make the bigger shifts.
28	We can make a bunch of small shifts around technology, as I just described, but ultimately, we have to look deeply at the dynamics in the network itself, and that's what we're doing.
29	CA: But what's your sense — what is the kind of thing that you might be able to change that would actually fundamentally shift behavior?
30	JD: Well, one of the things — we started the service with this concept of following an account, as an example, and I don't believe that's why people actually come to Twitter.
31	I believe Twitter is best as an interest-based network.
32	People come with a particular interest.
33	They have to do a ton of work to find and follow the related accounts around those interests.
34	What we could do instead is allow you to follow an interest, follow a hashtag, follow a trend, follow a community, which gives us the opportunity to show all of the accounts, all the topics, all the moments, all the hashtags that are associated with that particular topic and interest, which really opens up the perspective that you see.
35	But that is a huge fundamental shift to bias the entire network away from just an account bias towards a topics and interest bias.
36	CA: Because isn't it the case that one reason why you have so much content on there is a result of putting millions of people around the world in this kind of gladiatorial contest with each other for followers, for attention?
37	"Like, from the point of view of people who just read Twitter, that's not an issue, but for the people who actually create it, everyone's out there saying, ""You know, I wish I had a few more 'likes,' followers, retweets."""
38	And so they're constantly experimenting, trying to find the path to do that.
39	And what we've all discovered is that the number one path to do that is to be some form of provocative, obnoxious, eloquently obnoxious, like, eloquent insults are a dream on Twitter, where you rapidly pile up — and it becomes this self-fueling process of driving outrage.
40	How do you defuse that?
41	JD: Yeah, I mean, I think you're spot on, but that goes back to the incentives.
42	Like, one of the choices we made in the early days was we had this number that showed how many people follow you.
43	We decided that number should be big and bold, and anything that's on the page that's big and bold has importance, and those are the things that you want to drive.
44	Was that the right decision at the time?
45	Probably not.
46	If I had to start the service again, I would not emphasize the follower count as much.
47	"I would not emphasize the ""like"" count as much."
48	"I don't think I would even create ""like"" in the first place, because it doesn't actually push what we believe now to be the most important thing, which is healthy contribution back to the network and conversation to the network, participation within conversation, learning something from the conversation."
49	Those are not things that we thought of 13 years ago, and we believe are extremely important right now.
50	"So we have to look at how we display the follower count, how we display retweet count, how we display ""likes,"" and just ask the deep question: Is this really the number that we want people to drive up?"
51	"Is this the thing that, when you open Twitter, you see, ""That's the thing I need to increase?"""
52	And I don't believe that's the case right now.
53	(Applause)
54	WPR: I think we should look at some of the tweets that are coming in from the audience as well.
55	CA: Let's see what you guys are asking.
56	I mean, this is — generally, one of the amazing things about Twitter is how you can use it for crowd wisdom, you know, that more knowledge, more questions, more points of view than you can imagine, and sometimes, many of them are really healthy.
57	"WPR: I think one I saw that passed already quickly down here, ""What's Twitter's plan to combat foreign meddling in the 2020 US election?"""
58	I think that's something that's an issue we're seeing on the internet in general, that we have a lot of malicious automated activity happening.
59	And on Twitter, for example, in fact, we have some work that's come from our friends at Zignal Labs, and maybe we can even see that to give us an example of what exactly I'm talking about, where you have these bots, if you will, or coordinated automated malicious account activity, that is being used to influence things like elections.
60	And in this example we have from Zignal which they've shared with us using the data that they have from Twitter, you actually see that in this case, white represents the humans — human accounts, each dot is an account.
61	The pinker it is, the more automated the activity is.
62	And you can see how you have a few humans interacting with bots.
63	In this case, it's related to the election in Israel and spreading misinformation about Benny Gantz, and as we know, in the end, that was an election that Netanyahu won by a slim margin, and that may have been in some case influenced by this.
64	And when you think about that happening on Twitter, what are the things that you're doing, specifically, to ensure you don't have misinformation like this spreading in this way, influencing people in ways that could affect democracy?
65	JD: Just to back up a bit, we asked ourselves a question: Can we actually measure the health of a conversation, and what does that mean?
66	And in the same way that you have indicators and we have indicators as humans in terms of are we healthy or not, such as temperature, the flushness of your face, we believe that we could find the indicators of conversational health.
67	And we worked with a lab called Cortico at MIT to propose four starter indicators that we believe we could ultimately measure on the system.
68	And the first one is what we're calling shared attention.
69	It's a measure of how much of the conversation is attentive on the same topic versus disparate.
70	The second one is called shared reality, and this is what percentage of the conversation shares the same facts — not whether those facts are truthful or not, but are we sharing the same facts as we converse?
71	The third is receptivity: How much of the conversation is receptive or civil or the inverse, toxic?
72	And then the fourth is variety of perspective.
73	So, are we seeing filter bubbles or echo chambers, or are we actually getting a variety of opinions within the conversation?
74	And implicit in all four of these is the understanding that, as they increase, the conversation gets healthier and healthier.
75	So our first step is to see if we can measure these online, which we believe we can.
76	We have the most momentum around receptivity.
77	We have a toxicity score, a toxicity model, on our system that can actually measure whether you are likely to walk away from a conversation that you're having on Twitter because you feel it's toxic, with some pretty high degree.
78	We're working to measure the rest, and the next step is, as we build up solutions, to watch how these measurements trend over time and continue to experiment.
79	And our goal is to make sure that these are balanced, because if you increase one, you might decrease another.
80	If you increase variety of perspective, you might actually decrease shared reality.
81	CA: Just picking up on some of the questions flooding in here.
82	JD: Constant questioning.
83	CA: A lot of people are puzzled why, like, how hard is it to get rid of Nazis from Twitter?
84	JD: (Laughs)
85	So we have policies around violent extremist groups, and the majority of our work and our terms of service works on conduct, not content.
86	So we're actually looking for conduct.
87	Conduct being using the service to repeatedly or episodically harass someone, using hateful imagery that might be associated with the KKK or the American Nazi Party.
88	Those are all things that we act on immediately.
89	We're in a situation right now where that term is used fairly loosely, and we just cannot take any one mention of that word accusing someone else as a factual indication that they should be removed from the platform.
90	So a lot of our models are based around, number one: Is this account associated with a violent extremist group?
91	And if so, we can take action.
92	And we have done so on the KKK and the American Nazi Party and others.
93	And number two: Are they using imagery or conduct that would associate them as such as well?
94	CA: How many people do you have working on content moderation to look at this?
95	JD: It varies.
96	We want to be flexible on this, because we want to make sure that we're, number one, building algorithms instead of just hiring massive amounts of people, because we need to make sure that this is scalable, and there are no amount of people that can actually scale this.
97	So this is why we've done so much work around proactive detection of abuse that humans can then review.
98	We want to have a situation where algorithms are constantly scouring every single tweet and bringing the most interesting ones to the top so that humans can bring their judgment to whether we should take action or not, based on our terms of service.
99	WPR: But there's not an amount of people that are scalable, but how many people do you currently have monitoring these accounts, and how do you figure out what's enough?
100	JD: They're completely flexible.
101	Sometimes we associate folks with spam.
102	Sometimes we associate folks with abuse and harassment.
103	We're going to make sure that we have flexibility in our people so that we can direct them at what is most needed.
104	Sometimes, the elections.
105	We've had a string of elections in Mexico, one coming up in India, obviously, the election last year, the midterm election, so we just want to be flexible with our resources.
106	So when people — just as an example, if you go to our current terms of service and you bring the page up, and you're wondering about abuse and harassment that you just received and whether it was against our terms of service to report it, the first thing you see when you open that page is around intellectual property protection.
107	You scroll down and you get to abuse, harassment and everything else that you might be experiencing.
108	So I don't know how that happened over the company's history, but we put that above the thing that people want the most information on and to actually act on.
109	And just our ordering shows the world what we believed was important.
110	So we're changing all that.
111	We're ordering it the right way, but we're also simplifying the rules so that they're human-readable so that people can actually understand themselves when something is against our terms and when something is not.
112	And then we're making — again, our big focus is on removing the burden of work from the victims.
113	So that means push more towards technology, rather than humans doing the work — that means the humans receiving the abuse and also the humans having to review that work.
114	So we want to make sure that we're not just encouraging more work around something that's super, super negative, and we want to have a good balance between the technology and where humans can actually be creative, which is the judgment of the rules, and not just all the mechanical stuff of finding and reporting them.
115	So that's how we think about it.
116	CA: I'm curious to dig in more about what you said.
117	I mean, I love that you said you are looking for ways to re-tweak the fundamental design of the system to discourage some of the reactive behavior, and perhaps — to use Tristan Harris-type language — engage people's more reflective thinking.
118	How far advanced is that?
119	"What would alternatives to that ""like"" button be?"
120	JD: Well, first and foremost, my personal goal with the service is that I believe fundamentally that public conversation is critical.
121	There are existential problems facing the world that are facing the entire world, not any one particular nation-state, that global public conversation benefits.
122	And that is one of the unique dynamics of Twitter, that it is completely open, it is completely public, it is completely fluid, and anyone can see any other conversation and participate in it.
123	So there are conversations like climate change.
124	There are conversations like the displacement in the work through artificial intelligence.
125	There are conversations like economic disparity.
126	No matter what any one nation-state does, they will not be able to solve the problem alone.
127	It takes coordination around the world, and that's where I think Twitter can play a part.
128	The second thing is that Twitter, right now, when you go to it, you don't necessarily walk away feeling like you learned something.
129	Some people do.
130	Some people have a very, very rich network, a very rich community that they learn from every single day.
131	But it takes a lot of work and a lot of time to build up to that.
132	So we want to get people to those topics and those interests much, much faster and make sure that they're finding something that, no matter how much time they spend on Twitter — and I don't want to maximize the time on Twitter, I want to maximize what they actually take away from it and what they learn from it, and —
133	CA: Well, do you, though?
134	Because that's the core question that a lot of people want to know.
135	Surely, Jack, you're constrained, to a huge extent, by the fact that you're a public company, you've got investors pressing on you, the number one way you make your money is from advertising — that depends on user engagement.
136	Are you willing to sacrifice user time, if need be, to go for a more reflective conversation?
137	JD: Yeah; more relevance means less time on the service, and that's perfectly fine, because we want to make sure that, like, you're coming to Twitter, and you see something immediately that you learn from and that you push.
138	We can still serve an ad against that.
139	That doesn't mean you need to spend any more time to see more.
140	The second thing we're looking at —
141	CA: But just — on that goal, daily active usage, if you're measuring that, that doesn't necessarily mean things that people value every day.
142	It may well mean things that people are drawn to like a moth to the flame, every day.
143	We are addicted, because we see something that pisses us off, so we go in and add fuel to the fire, and the daily active usage goes up, and there's more ad revenue there, but we all get angrier with each other.
144	"How do you define ... ""Daily active usage"" seems like a really dangerous term to be optimizing."
145	(Applause)
146	JD: Taken alone, it is, but you didn't let me finish the other metric, which is, we're watching for conversations and conversation chains.
147	So we want to incentivize healthy contribution back to the network, and what we believe that is is actually participating in conversation that is healthy, as defined by those four indicators I articulated earlier.
148	So you can't just optimize around one metric.
149	You have to balance and look constantly at what is actually going to create a healthy contribution to the network and a healthy experience for people.
150	"Ultimately, we want to get to a metric where people can tell us, ""Hey, I learned something from Twitter, and I'm walking away with something valuable."""
151	That is our goal ultimately over time, but that's going to take some time.
152	CA: You come over to many, I think to me, as this enigma.
153	"This is possibly unfair, but I woke up the other night with this picture of how I found I was thinking about you and the situation, that we're on this great voyage with you on this ship called the ""Twittanic"" —"
154	(Laughter)
155	"and there are people on board in steerage who are expressing discomfort, and you, unlike many other captains, are saying, ""Well, tell me, talk to me, listen to me, I want to hear."""
156	"And they talk to you, and they say, ""We're worried about the iceberg ahead."""
157	"And you go, ""You know, that is a powerful point, and our ship, frankly, hasn't been built properly for steering as well as it might."""
158	"And we say, ""Please do something."""
159	"And you go to the bridge, and we're waiting, and we look, and then you're showing this extraordinary calm, but we're all standing outside, saying, ""Jack, turn the fucking wheel!"""
160	You know?
161	(Laughter)
162	(Applause)
163	I mean —
164	(Applause)
165	It's democracy at stake.
166	It's our culture at stake.
167	It's our world at stake.
168	And Twitter is amazing and shapes so much.
169	It's not as big as some of the other platforms, but the people of influence use it to set the agenda, and it's just hard to imagine a more important role in the world than to ...
170	I mean, you're doing a brilliant job of listening, Jack, and hearing people, but to actually dial up the urgency and move on this stuff — will you do that?
171	JD: Yes, and we have been moving substantially.
172	I mean, there's been a few dynamics in Twitter's history.
173	One, when I came back to the company, we were in a pretty dire state in terms of our future, and not just from how people were using the platform, but from a corporate narrative as well.
174	So we had to fix a bunch of the foundation, turn the company around, go through two crazy layoffs, because we just got too big for what we were doing, and we focused all of our energy on this concept of serving the public conversation.
175	And that took some work.
176	And as we dived into that, we realized some of the issues with the fundamentals.
177	We could do a bunch of superficial things to address what you're talking about, but we need the changes to last, and that means going really, really deep and paying attention to what we started 13 years ago and really questioning how the system works and how the framework works and what is needed for the world today, given how quickly everything is moving and how people are using it.
178	So we are working as quickly as we can, but quickness will not get the job done.
179	It's focus, it's prioritization, it's understanding the fundamentals of the network and building a framework that scales and that is resilient to change, and being open about where we are and being transparent about where are so that we can continue to earn trust.
180	So I'm proud of all the frameworks that we've put in place.
181	I'm proud of our direction.
182	We obviously can move faster, but that required just stopping a bunch of stupid stuff we were doing in the past.
183	CA: All right.
184	Well, I suspect there are many people here who, if given the chance, would love to help you on this change-making agenda you're on, and I don't know if Whitney — Jack, thank you for coming here and speaking so openly.
185	It took courage.
186	I really appreciate what you said, and good luck with your mission.
187	JD: Thank you so much.
188	Thanks for having me.
189	(Applause)
190	Thank you.
0	As a roboticist, I get asked a lot of questions.
1	"""When we will they start serving me breakfast?"""
2	So I thought the future of robotics would be looking more like us.
3	I thought they would look like me, so I built eyes that would simulate my eyes.
4	I built fingers that are dextrous enough to serve me ... baseballs.
5	Classical robots like this are built and become functional based on the fixed number of joints and actuators.
6	And this means their functionality and shape are already fixed at the moment of their conception.
7	So even though this arm has a really nice throw — it even hit the tripod at the end— it's not meant for cooking you breakfast per se.
8	It's not really suited for scrambled eggs.
9	So this was when I was hit by a new vision of future robotics: the transformers.
10	They drive, they run, they fly, all depending on the ever-changing, new environment and task at hand.
11	To make this a reality, you really have to rethink how robots are designed.
12	So, imagine a robotic module in a polygon shape and using that simple polygon shape to reconstruct multiple different forms to create a new form of robot for different tasks.
13	In CG, computer graphics, it's not any news — it's been done for a while, and that's how most of the movies are made.
14	But if you're trying to make a robot that's physically moving, it's a completely new story.
15	It's a completely new paradigm.
16	But you've all done this.
17	Who hasn't made a paper airplane, paper boat, paper crane?
18	Origami is a versatile platform for designers.
19	From a single sheet of paper, you can make multiple shapes, and if you don't like it, you unfold and fold back again.
20	Any 3D form can be made from 2D surfaces by folding, and this is proven mathematically.
21	And imagine if you were to have an intelligent sheet that can self-fold into any form it wants, anytime.
22	And that's what I've been working on.
23	"I call this robotic origami, ""robogami."""
24	This is our first robogami transformation that was made by me about 10 years ago.
25	From a flat-sheeted robot, it turns into a pyramid and back into a flat sheet and into a space shuttle.
26	Quite cute.
27	Ten years later, with my group of ninja origami robotic researchers — about 22 of them right now — we have a new generation of robogamis, and they're a little more effective and they do more than that.
28	So the new generation of robogamis actually serve a purpose.
29	For example, this one actually navigates through different terrains autonomously.
30	So when it's a dry and flat land, it crawls.
31	And if it meets sudden rough terrain, it starts rolling.
32	It does this — it's the same robot — but depending on which terrain it meets, it activates a different sequence of actuators that's on board.
33	And once it meets an obstacle, it jumps over it.
34	It does this by storing energy in each of its legs and releasing it and catapulting like a slingshot.
35	And it even does gymnastics.
36	Yay.
37	(Laughter)
38	So I just showed you what a single robogami can do.
39	Imagine what they can do as a group.
40	They can join forces to tackle more complex tasks.
41	Each module, either active or passive, we can assemble them to create different shapes.
42	Not only that, by controlling the folding joints, we're able to create and attack different tasks.
43	The form is making new task space.
44	And this time, what's most important is the assembly.
45	They need to autonomously find each other in a different space, attach and detach, depending on the environment and task.
46	And we can do this now.
47	So what's next?
48	Our imagination.
49	This is a simulation of what you can achieve with this type of module.
50	We decided that we were going to have a four-legged crawler turn into a little dog and make small gaits.
51	With the same module, we can actually make it do something else: a manipulator, a typical, classical robotic task.
52	So with a manipulator, it can pick up an object.
53	Of course, you can add more modules to make the manipulator legs longer to attack or pick up objects that are bigger or smaller, or even have a third arm.
54	For robogamis, there's no one fixed shape nor task.
55	They can transform into anything, anywhere, anytime.
56	So how do you make them?
57	The biggest technical challenge of robogami is keeping them super thin, flexible, but still remaining functional.
58	They're composed of multiple layers of circuits, motors, microcontrollers and sensors, all in the single body, and when you control individual folding joints, you'll be able to achieve soft motions like that upon your command.
59	Instead of being a single robot that is specifically made for a single task, robogamis are optimized to do multi-tasks.
60	And this is quite important for the difficult and unique environments on the Earth as well as in space.
61	Space is a perfect environment for robogamis.
62	You cannot afford to have one robot for one task.
63	Who knows how many tasks you will encounter in space?
64	What you want is a single robotic platform that can transform to do multi-tasks.
65	What we want is a deck of thin robogami modules that can transform to do multiples of performing tasks.
66	And don't take my word for it, because the European Space Agency and Swiss Space Center are sponsoring this exact concept.
67	So here you see a couple of images of reconfiguration of robogamis, exploring the foreign land aboveground, on the surface, as well as digging into the surface.
68	It's not just exploration.
69	For astronauts, they need additional help, because you cannot afford to bring interns up there, either.
70	(Laughter)
71	They have to do every tedious task.
72	They may be simple, but super interactive.
73	So you need robots to facilitate their experiments, assisting them with the communications and just docking onto surfaces to be their third arm holding different tools.
74	But how will they be able to control robogamis, for example, outside the space station?
75	In this case, I show a robogami that is holding space debris.
76	You can work with your vision so that you can control them, but what would be better is having the sensation of touch directly transported onto the hands of the astronauts.
77	And what you need is a haptic device, a haptic interface that recreates the sensation of touch.
78	And using robogamis, we can do this.
79	This is the world's smallest haptic interface that can recreate a sensation of touch just underneath your fingertip.
80	We do this by moving the robogami by microscopic and macroscopic movements at the stage.
81	And by having this, not only will you be able to feel how big the object is, the roundness and the lines, but also the stiffness and the texture.
82	Alex has this interface just underneath his thumb, and if he were to use this with VR goggles and hand controllers, now the virtual reality is no longer virtual.
83	It becomes a tangible reality.
84	The blue ball, red ball and black ball that he's looking at is no longer differentiated by colors.
85	Now it is a rubber blue ball, sponge red ball and billiard black ball.
86	This is now possible.
87	Let me show you.
88	This is really the first time this is shown live in front of a public grand audience, so hopefully this works.
89	So what you see here is an atlas of anatomy and the robogami haptic interface.
90	So, like all the other reconfigurable robots, it multitasks.
91	Not only is it going to serve as a mouse, but also a haptic interface.
92	So for example, we have a white background where there is no object.
93	That means there is nothing to feel, so we can have a very, very flexible interface.
94	Now, I use this as a mouse to approach skin, a muscular arm, so now let's feel his biceps, or shoulders.
95	So now you see how much stiffer it becomes.
96	Let's explore even more.
97	Let's approach the ribcage.
98	And as soon as I move on top of the ribcage and between the intercostal muscles, which is softer and harder, I can feel the difference of the stiffness.
99	Take my word for it.
100	So now you see, it's much stiffer in terms of the force it's giving back to my fingertip.
101	So I showed you the surfaces that aren't moving.
102	How about if I were to approach something that moves, for example, like a beating heart?
103	What would I feel?
104	(Applause)
105	This can be your beating heart.
106	This can actually be inside your pocket while you're shopping online.
107	Now you'll be able to feel the difference of the sweater that you're buying, how soft it is, if it's actually cashmere or not, or the bagel that you're trying to buy, how hard it is or how crispy it is.
108	This is now possible.
109	The robotics technology is advancing to be more personalized and adaptive, to adapt to our everyday needs.
110	This unique specie of reconfigurable robotics is actually the platform to provide this invisible, intuitive interface to meet our exact needs.
111	These robots will no longer look like the characters from the movies.
112	Instead, they will be whatever you want them to be.
113	Thank you.
114	(Applause)
0	So, a little while ago, members of my family had three bits of minor surgery, about a half hour each, and we got three sets of bills.
1	For the first one, the anesthesia bill alone was 2,000 dollars; the second one, 2,000 dollars; the third one, 6,000 dollars.
2	So I'm a journalist.
3	I'm like, what's up with that?
4	I found out that I was actually, for the expensive one, being charged 1,419 dollars for a generic anti-nausea drug that I could buy online for two dollars and forty-nine cents.
5	I had a long and unsatisfactory argument with the hospital, the insurer and my employer.
6	Everybody agreed that this was totally fine.
7	But it got me thinking, and the more I talked to people, the more I realized: nobody has any idea what stuff costs in health care.
8	Not before, during or after that procedure or test do you have any idea what it's going to cost.
9	"It's only months later that you get an ""explanation of benefits"" that explains exactly nothing."
10	So this came back to me a little while later.
11	I had volunteered for a buyout from the New York Times, where I had worked for more than 20 years as a journalist.
12	I was looking for my next act.
13	It turned out that next act was to build a company telling people what stuff costs in health care.
14	"I won a ""Shark Tank""-type pitch contest to do just that."
15	Health costs ate up almost 18 percent of our gross domestic product last year, but nobody has any idea what stuff costs.
16	But what if we did know?
17	So we started out small.
18	We called doctors and hospitals and asked them what they would accept as a cash payment for simple procedures.
19	Some people were helpful.
20	A lot of people hung up on us.
21	Some people were just plain rude.
22	"They said, ""We don't know,"" or, ""Our lawyers won't let us tell you that,"" though we did get a lot of information."
23	We found, for example, that here in the New York area, you could get an echocardiogram for 200 dollars in Brooklyn or for 2,150 dollars in Manhattan, just a few miles away.
24	New Orleans, the same simple blood test, 19 dollars over here, 522 dollars just a few blocks away.
25	San Francisco, the same MRI, 475 dollars or 6,221 dollars just 25 miles away.
26	These pricing variations existed for all the procedures and all the cities that we surveyed.
27	Then we started to ask people to tell us their health bills.
28	In partnership with public radio station WNYC here in New York, we asked women to tell us the prices of their mammograms.
29	People told us nobody would do that, that it was too personal.
30	But in the space of three weeks, 400 women told us about their prices.
31	Then we started to make it easier for people to share their data into our online searchable database.
32	It's sort of like a mash-up of Kayak.com and the Waze traffic app for health care.
33	(Laughter)
34	We call it a community-created guide to health costs.
35	Our survey and crowdsourcing work grew into partnerships with top newsrooms nationwide — in New Orleans, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami and other places.
36	"We used the data to tell stories about people who were suffering and how to avoid that suffering, to avoid that ""gotcha"" bill."
37	A woman in New Orleans saved nearly 4,000 dollars using our data.
38	A San Francisco contributor saved nearly 1,300 dollars by putting away his insurance card and paying cash.
39	There are a lot of people who are going to in-network hospitals and getting out-of-network bills.
40	And then there was the hospital that continued to bill a dead man.
41	We learned that thousands of people wanted to tell us their prices.
42	They want to learn what stuff costs, find out how to argue a bill, help us solve this problem that's hurting them and their friends and families.
43	We talked to people who had to sell a car to pay a health bill, go into bankruptcy, skip a treatment because of the cost.
44	Imagine if you could afford the diagnosis but not the cure.
45	We set off a huge conversation about costs involving doctors and hospitals, yes, but also their patients, or as we like to call them, people.
46	(Laughter)
47	We changed policy.
48	A consumer protection bill that had been stalled in the Louisiana legislature for 10 years passed after we launched.
49	Let's face it: this huge, slow-rolling public health crisis is a national emergency.
50	And I don't think government's going to help us out anytime soon.
51	But what if the answer was really simple: make all the prices public all the time.
52	Would our individual bills go down?
53	Our health premiums?
54	Be really clear about this: this is a United States problem.
55	In most of the rest of the developed world, sick people don't have to worry about money.
56	It's also true that price transparency will not solve every problem.
57	There will still be expensive treatments, huge friction from our insurance system.
58	There will still be fraud and a massive problem with overtreatment and overdiagnosis.
59	And not everything is shoppable.
60	Not everybody wants the cheapest appendectomy or the cheapest cancer care.
61	But when we talk about these clear effects, we're looking at a real issue that's actually very simple.
62	When we first started calling for prices, we actually felt like we were going to be arrested.
63	It seemed kind of transgressive to talk about medicine and health care in the same breath, and yet it became liberating, because we found not only data but also good and honest people out there in the system who want to help folks get the care they need at a price they can afford.
64	And it got easier to ask.
65	So I'll leave you with some questions.
66	What if we all knew what stuff cost in health care in advance?
67	What if, every time you Googled for an MRI, you got drop-downs telling you where to buy and for how much, the way you do when you Google for a laser printer?
68	What if all of the time and energy and money that's spent hiding prices was squeezed out of the system?
69	What if each one of us could pick the $19 test every time instead of the $522 one?
70	Would our individual bills go down?
71	Our premiums?
72	I don't know, but if you don't ask, you'll never know.
73	And you might save a ton of money.
74	And I've got to think that a lot of us and the system itself would be a lot healthier.
75	Thank you.
76	(Applause)
0	In 132 CE, Chinese polymath Zhang Heng presented the Han court with his latest invention.
1	This large vase, he claimed, could tell them whenever an earthquake occurred in their kingdom– including the direction they should send aid.
2	The court was somewhat skeptical, especially when the device triggered on a seemingly quiet afternoon.
3	But when messengers came for help days later, their doubts turned to gratitude.
4	Today, we no longer rely on pots to identify seismic events, but earthquakes still offer a unique challenge to those trying to track them.
5	So why are earthquakes so hard to anticipate, and how could we get better at predicting them?
6	To answer that, we need to understand some theories behind how earthquakes occur.
7	Earth’s crust is made from several vast, jagged slabs of rock called tectonic plates, each riding on a hot, partially molten layer of Earth’s mantle.
8	This causes the plates to spread very slowly, at anywhere from 1 to 20 centimeters per year.
9	But these tiny movements are powerful enough to cause deep cracks in the interacting plates.
10	And in unstable zones, the intensifying pressure may ultimately trigger an earthquake.
11	It’s hard enough to monitor these miniscule movements, but the factors that turn shifts into seismic events are far more varied.
12	Different fault lines juxtapose different rocks– some of which are stronger–or weaker– under pressure.
13	Diverse rocks also react differently to friction and high temperatures.
14	Some partially melt, and can release lubricating fluids made of superheated minerals that reduce fault line friction.
15	But some are left dry, prone to dangerous build-ups of pressure.
16	And all these faults are subject to varying gravitational forces, as well as the currents of hot rocks moving throughout Earth’s mantle.
17	So which of these hidden variables should we be analyzing, and how do they fit into our growing prediction toolkit?
18	Because some of these forces occur at largely constant rates, the behavior of the plates is somewhat cyclical.
19	Today, many of our most reliable clues come from long-term forecasting, related to when and where earthquakes have previously occurred.
20	At the scale of millennia, this allows us to make predictions about when highly active faults, like the San Andreas, are overdue for a massive earthquake.
21	But due to the many variables involved, this method can only predict very loose timeframes.
22	To predict more imminent events, researchers have investigated the vibrations Earth elicits before a quake.
23	Geologists have long used seismometers to track and map these tiny shifts in the earth’s crust.
24	And today, most smartphones are also capable of recording primary seismic waves.
25	With a network of phones around the globe, scientists could potentially crowdsource a rich, detailed warning system that alerts people to incoming quakes.
26	Unfortunately, phones might not be able to provide the advance notice needed to enact safety protocols.
27	But such detailed readings would still be useful for prediction tools like NASA’s Quakesim software, which can use a rigorous blend of geological data to identify regions at risk.
28	However, recent studies indicate the most telling signs of a quake might be invisible to all these sensors.
29	In 2011, just before an earthquake struck the east coast of Japan, nearby researchers recorded surprisingly high concentrations of the radioactive isotope pair: radon and thoron.
30	As stress builds up in the crust right before an earthquake, microfractures allow these gases to escape to the surface.
31	These scientists think that if we built a vast network of radon-thoron detectors in earthquake-prone areas, it could become a promising warning system– potentially predicting quakes a week in advance.
32	Of course, none of these technologies would be as helpful as simply looking deep inside the earth itself.
33	With a deeper view we might be able to track and predict large-scale geological changes in real time, possibly saving tens of thousands of lives a year.
34	But for now, these technologies can help us prepare and respond quickly to areas in need– without waiting for directions from a vase.
0	So let me with start with Roy Amara.
1	Roy's argument is that most new technologies tend to be overestimated in their impact to begin with, and then they get underestimated in the long term because we get used to them.
2	These really are days of miracle and wonder.
3	You remember that wonderful song by Paul Simon?
4	There were two lines in it.
5	So what was it that was considered miraculous back then?
6	Slowing down things — slow motion — and the long-distance call.
7	"Because, of course, you used to get interrupted by operators who'd tell you, ""Long distance calling."
8	"Do you want to hang up?"""
9	And now we think nothing of calling all over the world.
10	Well, something similar may be happening with reading and programming life.
11	But before I unpack that, let's just talk about telescopes.
12	Telescopes were overestimated originally in their impact.
13	This is one of Galileo's early models.
14	People thought it was just going to ruin all religion.
15	(Laughter)
16	So we're not paying that much attention to telescopes.
17	But, of course, telescopes launched 10 years ago, as you just heard, could take this Volkswagen, fly it to the moon, and you could see the lights on that Volkswagen light up on the moon.
18	And that's the kind of resolution power that allowed you to see little specks of dust floating around distant suns.
19	Imagine for a second that this was a sun a billion light years away, and you had a little speck of dust that came in front of it.
20	That's what detecting an exoplanet is like.
21	And the cool thing is, the telescopes that are now being launched would allow you to see a single candle lit on the moon.
22	And if you separated it by one plate, you could see two candles separately at that distance.
23	And that's the kind of resolution that you need to begin to image that little speck of dust as it comes around the sun and see if it has a blue-green signature.
24	And if it does have a blue-green signature, it means that life is common in the universe.
25	The first time you ever see a blue-green signature on a distant planet, it means there's photosynthesis there, there's water there, and the chances that you saw the only other planet with photosynthesis are about zero.
26	And that's a calendar-changing event.
27	There's a before and after we were alone in the universe: forget about the discovery of whatever continent.
28	So as you're thinking about this, we're now beginning to be able to image most of the universe.
29	And that is a time of miracle and wonder.
30	And we kind of take that for granted.
31	Something similar is happening in life.
32	So we're hearing about life in these little bits and pieces.
33	We hear about CRISPR, and we hear about this technology, and we hear about this technology.
34	But the bottom line on life is that life turns out to be code.
35	And life as code is a really important concept because it means, just in the same way as you can write a sentence in English or in French or Chinese, just in the same way as you can copy a sentence, just in the same way as you can edit a sentence, just in the same way as you can print a sentence, you're beginning to be able to do that with life.
36	It means that we're beginning to learn how to read this language.
37	And this, of course, is the language that is used by this orange.
38	So how does this orange execute code?
39	It doesn't do it in ones and zeroes like a computer does.
40	It sits on a tree, and one day it does: plop!
41	And that means: execute.
42	AATCAAG: make me a little root.
43	TCGACC: make me a little stem.
44	GAC: make me some leaves.
45	AGC: make me some flowers.
46	And then GCAA: make me some more oranges.
47	If I edit a sentence in English on a word processor, then what happens is you can go from this word to that word.
48	If I edit something in this orange and put in GCAAC, using CRISPR or something else that you've heard of, then this orange becomes a lemon, or it becomes a grapefruit, or it becomes a tangerine.
49	And if I edit one in a thousand letters, you become the person sitting next to you today.
50	Be more careful where you sit.
51	(Laughter)
52	What's happening on this stuff is it was really expensive to begin with.
53	It was like long-distance calls.
54	But the cost of this is dropping 50 percent faster than Moore's law.
55	The first $200 full genome was announced yesterday by Veritas.
56	And so as you're looking at these systems, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, and then it does.
57	So let me just give you the map view of this stuff.
58	This is a big discovery.
59	There's 23 chromosomes.
60	Cool.
61	Let's now start using a telescope version, but instead of using a telescope, let's use a microscope to zoom in on the inferior of those chromosomes, which is the Y chromosome.
62	It's a third the size of the X.
63	It's recessive and mutant.
64	But hey, just a male.
65	And as you're looking at this stuff, here's kind of a country view at a 400 base pair resolution level, and then you zoom in to 550, and then you zoom in to 850, and you can begin to identify more and more genes as you zoom in.
66	Then you zoom in to the state level, and you can begin to tell who's got leukemia, how did they get leukemia, what kind of leukemia do they have, what shifted from what place to what place.
67	And then you zoom in to the Google street view level.
68	So this is what happens if you have colorectal cancer for a very specific patient on the letter-by-letter resolution.
69	So what we're doing in this stuff is we're gathering information and just generating enormous amounts of information.
70	This is one of the largest databases on the planet and it's growing faster than we can build computers to store it.
71	You can create some incredible maps with this stuff.
72	You want to understand the plague and why one plague is bubonic and the other one is a different kind of plague and the other one is a different kind of plague?
73	Well, here's a map of the plague.
74	Some are absolutely deadly to humans, some are not.
75	And note, by the way, as you go to the bottom of this, how does it compare to tuberculosis?
76	So this is the difference between tuberculosis and various kinds of plagues, and you can play detective with this stuff, because you can take a very specific kind of cholera that affected Haiti, and you can look at which country it came from, which region it came from, and probably which soldier took that from that African country to Haiti.
77	Zoom out.
78	It's not just zooming in.
79	This is one of the coolest maps ever done by human beings.
80	What they've done is taken all the genetic information they have about all the species, and they've put a tree of life on a single page that you can zoom in and out of.
81	So this is what came first, how did it diversify, how did it branch, how large is that genome, on a single page.
82	It's kind of the universe of life on Earth, and it's being constantly updated and completed.
83	And so as you're looking at this stuff, the really important change is the old biology used to be reactive.
84	You used to have a lot of biologists that had microscopes, and they had magnifying glasses and they were out observing animals.
85	The new biology is proactive.
86	You don't just observe stuff, you make stuff.
87	And that's a really big change because it allows us to do things like this.
88	And I know you're really excited by this picture.
89	(Laughter)
90	It only took us four years and 40 million dollars to be able to take this picture.
91	(Laughter)
92	And what we did is we took the full gene code out of a cell — not a gene, not two genes, the full gene code out of a cell — built a completely new gene code, inserted it into the cell, figured out a way to have the cell execute that code and built a completely new species.
93	So this is the world's first synthetic life form.
94	And so what do you do with this stuff?
95	Well, this stuff is going to change the world.
96	Let me give you three short-term trends in terms of how it's going to change the world.
97	The first is we're going to see a new industrial revolution.
98	And I actually mean that literally.
99	So in the same way as Switzerland and Germany and Britain changed the world with machines like the one you see in this lobby, created power — in the same way CERN is changing the world, using new instruments and our concept of the universe — programmable life forms are also going to change the world because once you can program cells in the same way as you program your computer chip, then you can make almost anything.
100	So your computer chip can produce photographs, can produce music, can produce film, can produce love letters, can produce spreadsheets.
101	It's just ones and zeroes flying through there.
102	If you can flow ATCGs through cells, then this software makes its own hardware, which means it scales very quickly.
103	No matter what happens, if you leave your cell phone by your bedside, you will not have a billion cell phones in the morning.
104	But if you do that with living organisms, you can make this stuff at a very large scale.
105	One of the things you can do is you can start producing close to carbon-neutral fuels on a commercial scale by 2025, which we're doing with Exxon.
106	But you can also substitute for agricultural lands.
107	Instead of having 100 hectares to make oils or to make proteins, you can make it in these vats at 10 or 100 times the productivity per hectare.
108	Or you can store information, or you can make all the world's vaccines in those three vats.
109	Or you can store most of the information that's held at CERN in those three vats.
110	DNA is a really powerful information storage device.
111	Second turn: you're beginning to see the rise of theoretical biology.
112	So, medical school departments are one of the most conservative places on earth.
113	The way they teach anatomy is similar to the way they taught anatomy 100 years ago.
114	"""Welcome, student."
115	"Here's your cadaver."""
116	One of the things medical schools are not good at is creating new departments, which is why this is so unusual.
117	Isaac Kohane has now created a department based on informatics, data, knowledge at Harvard Medical School.
118	And in a sense, what's beginning to happen is biology is beginning to get enough data that it can begin to follow the steps of physics, which used to be observational physics and experimental physicists, and then started creating theoretical biology.
119	Well, that's what you're beginning to see because you have so many medical records, because you have so much data about people: you've got their genomes, you've got their viromes, you've got their microbiomes.
120	And as this information stacks, you can begin to make predictions.
121	The third thing that's happening is this is coming to the consumer.
122	So you, too, can get your genes sequenced.
123	And this is beginning to create companies like 23andMe, and companies like 23andMe are going to be giving you more and more and more data, not just about your relatives, but about you and your body, and it's going to compare stuff, and it's going to compare stuff across time, and these are going to become very large databases.
124	But it's also beginning to affect a series of other businesses in unexpected ways.
125	Normally, when you advertise something, you really don't want the consumer to take your advertisement into the bathroom to pee on.
126	Unless, of course, if you're IKEA.
127	Because when you rip this out of a magazine and you pee on it, it'll turn blue if you're pregnant.
128	(Laughter)
129	And they'll give you a discount on your crib.
130	(Laughter)
131	Right?
132	So when I say consumer empowerment, and this is spreading beyond biotech, I actually really mean that.
133	We're now beginning to produce, at Synthetic Genomics, desktop printers that allow you to design a cell, print a cell, execute the program on the cell.
134	We can now print vaccines real time as an airplane takes off before it lands.
135	We're shipping 78 of these machines this year.
136	This is not theoretical biology.
137	This is printing biology.
138	Let me talk about two long-term trends that are coming at you over a longer time period.
139	The first one is, we're starting to redesign species.
140	And you've heard about that, right?
141	We're redesigning trees.
142	We're redesigning flowers.
143	We're redesigning yogurt, cheese, whatever else you want.
144	And that, of course, brings up the interesting question: How and when should we redesign humans?
145	"And a lot of us think, ""Oh no, we never want to redesign humans."""
146	Unless, of course, if your child has a Huntington's gene and is condemned to death.
147	Or, unless if you're passing on a cystic fibrosis gene, in which case, you don't just want to redesign yourself, you want to redesign your children and their children.
148	And these are complicated debates and they're going to happen in real time.
149	I'll give you one current example.
150	One of the debates going on at the National Academies today is you have the power to put a gene drive into mosquitoes so that you will kill all the malaria-carrying mosquitoes.
151	"Now, some people say, ""That's going to affect the environment in an extreme way, don't do it."""
152	"Other people say, ""This is one of the things that's killing millions of people yearly."
153	"Who are you to tell me that I can't save the kids in my country?"""
154	And why is this debate so complicated?
155	Because as soon as you let this loose in Brazil or in Southern Florida — mosquitoes don't respect walls.
156	You're making a decision for the world when you put a gene drive into the air.
157	This wonderful man won a Nobel Prize, and after winning the Nobel Prize he's been worrying about how did life get started on this planet and how likely is it that it's in other places?
158	"So what he's been doing is going around to this graduate students and saying to his graduate students, ""Build me life but don't use any modern chemicals or instruments."
159	Build me stuff that was here three billion years ago.
160	You can't use lasers.
161	You can't use this.
162	"You can't use that."""
163	He gave me a vial of what he's built about three weeks ago.
164	What has he built?
165	He's built basically what looked like soap bubbles that are made out of lipids.
166	He's built a precursor of RNA.
167	He's had the precursor of the RNA be absorbed by the cell and then he's had the cells divide.
168	We may not be that far — call it a decade, maybe two decades — from generating life from scratch out of proto-communities.
169	Second long-term trend: we've been living and are living through the digital age — we're starting to live through the age of the genome and biology and CRISPR and synthetic biology — and all of that is going to merge into the age of the brain.
170	So we're getting to the point where we can rebuild most of our body parts, in the same way as if you break a bone or burn your skin, it regrows.
171	We're beginning to learn how to regrow our tracheas or how to regrow our bladders.
172	Both of those have been implanted in humans.
173	Tony Atala is working on 32 different organs.
174	But the core is going to be this, because this is you and the rest is just packaging.
175	Nobody's going to live beyond 120, 130, 140 years unless if we fix this.
176	And that's the most interesting challenge.
177	"That's the next frontier, along with: ""How common is life in the universe?"""
178	"""Where did we come from?"""
179	and questions like that.
180	Let me end this with an apocryphal quote from Einstein.
181	[You can live as if everything is a miracle, or you can live as if nothing is a miracle.]
182	It's your choice.
183	You can focus on the bad, you can focus on the scary, and certainly there's a lot of scary out there.
184	But use 10 percent of your brain to focus on that, or maybe 20 percent, or maybe 30 percent.
185	But just remember, we really are living in an age of miracle and wonder.
186	We're lucky to be alive today.
187	We're lucky to see this stuff.
188	We're lucky to be able to interact with folks like the folks who are building all the stuff in this room.
189	So thank you to all of you, for all you do.
190	(Applause)
0	Human origins.
1	Who are we?
2	Where do we come from, and how do we know?
3	"In my field, paleoanthropology, we explore human origins — the ""who"" and ""where"" questions — by analyzing fossils that date back thousands and even millions of years."
4	In 2015, a team of colleagues and I named a new species in the genus Homo — our genus — Homo naledi.
5	Let's take a step back and put that into context.
6	The last common ancestors between humans and chimps date somewhere between six and eight million years.
7	The earliest hominins, or earliest human ancestors, evolved into a group known as the australopithecines.
8	The australopithecines evolved into the genus Homo and eventually modern humans — us.
9	With each new fossil discovery, we get a little bit closer to better understanding who we are and where we came from.
10	With these new fossil finds, we realize we now have to make changes to this tree.
11	Until this discovery, we thought we had a pretty good idea about the patterns of evolutionary change.
12	Current fossil evidence suggests that the earliest populations of the genus Homo evolved in Africa somewhere between two and three million years.
13	Fast-forward to approximately 300,000 years to where we see the origins of the first modern humans.
14	While the fossil record between these time frames in Africa is relatively sparse, the fossils nonetheless demonstrated certain trends from our earliest ancestors to modern humans.
15	For example, our brains were becoming larger relative the rest of our body.
16	Our pelves were becoming more bowl-shaped, and our hand-wrist morphology, or form, suggested a change in our grip as we began to make and use stone tools and spend less time in the trees.
17	These new fossils disrupt everything we thought we knew about these trends and force us to change the way that we think about human evolution.
18	South Africa in general, but the Cradle of Humankind in particular, contains numerous sites where hundreds of thousands of fossils have been found.
19	As an undergraduate student, I fell in love with one of them ... Mrs. Ples.
20	The skull of a 2.1-million-year-old early human ancestor.
21	From that point on, I was determined to go to South Africa and study human evolution.
22	I first traveled there in 2003, and I did get to see my beloved Mrs. Ples.
23	(Laughter)
24	But words can hardly convey my excitement when I was chosen as an early career scientist by Lee Berger, a world-renowned paleoanthropologist, to be one of the primary analysts of recently excavated unpublished fossils.
25	This treasure trove of fossils was being recovered from a new site called the Dinaledi Chamber in the Rising Star cave system.
26	Species are often named based on a skull, a lower jaw, or, very rarely, a handful of postcranial, or below-the-neck, elements.
27	The fossils from Dinaledi were another story altogether.
28	An unprecedented approximately 1800 specimens — so far — have been excavated from the Rising Star system, representing at least 15 individual skeletons.
29	The research team that I was invited to join was tasked with describing, comparing and analyzing the fossils, with the difficult goal of identifying to what species the fossils belonged.
30	We were divided up into our different areas of expertise.
31	We were divided up in different areas of the lab, too.
32	"So there was ""Hand Land,"" for the fossil hand people, ""Hip Heaven"" for the pelvis ..."
33	"I was in the ""Tooth Booth."""
34	(Laughter)
35	And after long, intense days in the lab, the different teams would meet up at night and discuss our findings, still consumed by questions from our analyses.
36	It was incredible how different the interpretations were.
37	Each body part seemed to come from a different species, based on what we knew from the fossil record.
38	The suite of characteristics we were seeing didn't match any known species.
39	And if we had only recovered the skull, we might have called it one thing; if we had only recovered the pelvis, we might have called it another.
40	The anatomy of the skeletons didn't make sense with the framework of what we thought we knew of human evolution.
41	Did it belong in the genus Homo?
42	Should it be an australopithecine?
43	Those bipedal, more apelike ancestors?
44	Or perhaps it should be its own species.
45	"Ultimately, after much deliberation, we decided the Rising Star specimens did indeed warrant a new species, which we called ""Homo naledi."""
46	From the head to the feet, the fossils present a mosaic of primitive, or ancestral, and derived or more modern-like features.
47	The skull is quite derived, appearing most similar to early representatives of the genus Homo, like Homo habilis and Homo erectus.
48	However, the brain is scarcely half the size of a modern human one.
49	One that is smaller than any other early Homo that has ever been found.
50	As someone who studies teeth, I might argue these are the coolest fossils found at the site.
51	(Laughter)
52	The assemblage consists of 190 whole or fragmentary teeth that range in age from very old to very young.
53	Like the skeletons, the teeth present a mix of primitive and derived traits.
54	In modern humans, the third molar is typically the smallest, while the first molar is the biggest, but Homo naledi has the primitive condition where the third molar is the biggest and the first molar is the smallest.
55	The anterior teeth, or the incisors and canines, are small for the genus Homo, and the lower canine has a cuspulid on it — an extra cuspule that gives it a distinct mitten-like shape that it shares with some specimens of the early human, Homo erectus.
56	The overall shape of the teeth looked odd to me, so I performed crown-shape analysis on the occlusal surfaces of deciduous teeth, or baby teeth — on your left — and the permanent premolars and molars on your right.
57	The deciduous teeth are especially narrow, and the premolars are unique in their outline shape compared to other hominids.
58	In fact, when I compare the outlines, when I lay them on top of each other, they look very similar.
59	"We say they have ""low intraspecific variations,"" so the variation within the species is low."
60	When I compare this to groups like the australopithecines, the intraspecific variation is much larger.
61	Postcranially, the team concluded that the position of the shoulders suggesting naledi was a climber; the flared pelvis and curved fingers are all primitive for the genus Homo.
62	On the other hand, the humanlike wrist, long slender legs and modern feet are all consistent with other members of the genus.
63	In 2017, we announced more specimens of Homo naledi from the nearby Lesedi Chamber, also in the Rising Star cave system.
64	In addition, our geology team managed to produce an age estimate.
65	The date's a big deal because, up until now, we had based our analysis solely on the morphology of the specimens, without previous knowledge of how old something is — something which could unconsciously bias our interpretations.
66	With its small brain and flared pelvis, we would not have been surprised if the fossils turned out to be two million years old.
67	Instead, the fossils dated to 235 to 336 thousand years, an incredibly young date for such a small-brained individual.
68	So think back to what I said earlier: we thought that our brains were becoming larger relative to the rest of our body.
69	Now we have a small-brained, young individual complicating this idea.
70	What does all this mean?
71	Homo naledi has taught us that we need to reassess what it means to be in the genus Homo.
72	We need to rethink what it means to be human.
73	In fact, most of the characteristics that we use to define the genus Homo, such as brain size and hip morphology, are no longer valid.
74	No other species exists with this mix of primitive and derived traits.
75	Why is there so much morphological variation in the genus Homo?
76	And what force is driving that variation?
77	Another implication for these fossils is that for the first time, we have concrete evidence of a species coexisting in Africa, at 300,000 years, with modern humans.
78	Until this discovery, we only had large-brained modern humans that existed in Africa.
79	Did they interbreed with each other?
80	Did they compete with each other?
81	Another implication that these fossils have is for the archaeologists studying stone tools in South Africa.
82	Keep in mind that neither the Dinaledi nor the Lesedi Chambers have any artifacts in them.
83	However, they do overlap in time with several stone-tool industries, the makers of which are considered to be either modern humans or direct human ancestors.
84	This begs the question: Who made the stone tools of South Africa?
85	Brain size has historically played a key role in identifying a species as a tool user.
86	The idea is that you need to have a large brain to have even the capacity to make stone tools.
87	But that notion has been questioned.
88	Furthermore, Homo naledi, even with its small brain size, has a hand-wrist morphology similar to other species that did make and use stone tools, suggesting it had the capability.
89	With two species coexisting in Africa at 300,000 years, we can no longer assume we know the maker of tools at sites with no associated species.
90	So where does Homo naledi fit in our human evolutionary lineage?
91	Who is it most closely related to?
92	Who did it evolve from?
93	We're still trying to figure all that out.
94	It's ironic, because paleoanthropologists are renowned for having small sample sizes.
95	We now have a large sample size, and more questions than answers.
96	Homo naledi has taught us, has brought us a little bit closer to better understanding our evolutionary past.
97	So while Mrs. Ples will always hold a special place in my heart, she now shares that space with several thousand others.
98	(Laughter)
99	Thank you.
100	(Applause)
0	When I was a kid, I was afraid of the dark.
1	The darkness is where the monsters are.
2	And I had this little night light outside of my bedroom so that it would never get too dark.
3	But over time, my fear of the dark turned to curiosity.
4	"What is out there in the ""dark-dark?"""
5	And it turns out that trying to understand the darkness is something that's fascinated humans for thousands of years, maybe forever.
6	And we know this because we find their ancient relics of their attempts to map the sky.
7	This tusk is over 30,000 years old.
8	Some people think that it's a carving of Orion or maybe a calendar.
9	We don't know.
10	The Fuxi star map is over 6,000 years old, and it's from a neolithic tomb in ancient China.
11	And that little pile of clamshells underneath the dead guy's foot in the middle — that's supposed to be the Big Dipper.
12	Maybe.
13	The Nebra disk is uncontroversial.
14	You don't have to be an astronomer to know that you're looking at the Moon phases or the Sun in eclipse.
15	And that little group of seven stars, that's the Pleiades, the Seven Sisters.
16	But in any case, the point is clear: astronomers have been mapping the sky for a long time.
17	Why?
18	It's our calling card as a species in the galaxy to figure things out.
19	We know our planet, we cure our diseases, we cook our food, we leave our planet.
20	But it's not easy.
21	Understanding the universe is battle.
22	It is unrelenting, it is time-varying, and it is one we are all in together.
23	It is a battle in the darkness against the darkness.
24	Which is why Orion has weapons.
25	In any case, if you're going to engage in this battle, you need to know the battlefield.
26	So at its core, mapping the sky involves three essential elements.
27	You've got objects that are giving off light, you've got telescopes that are collecting that light, and you've got instruments that are helping you understand what that light is.
28	Many of you have mapped the Moon phases over time with your eyes, your eyes being your more basic telescope.
29	And you've understood what that means with your brains, your brains being one of your more basic instruments.
30	Now, if you and a buddy get together, you would spend over 30 years, you would map 1,000 stars extremely precisely.
31	You would move the front line to the battle.
32	And that's what Tycho Brahe and his buddy, or his assistant, really, Johannes Kepler did back in the 1600s.
33	And they moved the line, figured out how planets worked, how they moved around the Sun.
34	But it wasn't until about 100 years ago that we realized it's a big universe.
35	It seems like the universe is just infinite, which it is, but the observable universe is finite.
36	Which means we can win the battle.
37	But if you're going to map the universe, you're not going to do it with one or two of your besties.
38	Mapping the universe takes an army, an army of curious, creative, craftspeople who, working together, can accomplish the extraordinary.
39	I lead this army of creatives, in the fifth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, SDSS.
40	And this is how astronomers have managed to shepherd individual curiosity through its industrial age, preserving the individual ability to make discoveries but putting into place mega machinery to truly advance the frontier.
41	In SDSS, we divide the sky into three mappers: one for the stars, one for the black holes and one for the galaxies.
42	My survey has two hemispheres, five telescopes, or 11, depending on how you count, 10 spectrographs and millions of objects.
43	It's a monster.
44	So let's go through the mappers.
45	The Milky Way galaxy has 250 billion plus or minus a few hundred billion stars.
46	That is not a number that you hold in your head.
47	That is a number that doesn't make practical sense to pretty much anybody.
48	You never get 250 billion jelly beans in your hand.
49	You know?
50	We're nowhere near mapping all of those stars yet.
51	So we have to choose the most interesting ones.
52	In SDSS-V, we're mapping six million stars where we think we can measure their age.
53	Because if you can measure the age of a star, that's like having six million clocks spread all throughout the Milky Way.
54	And with that information, we can unravel the history and fossil record of our galaxy and learn how it formed.
55	I'm just going to cut right to the chase here.
56	Black holes are among the most perplexing objects in the universe.
57	Why?
58	Because they are literally just math incarnate, in a physical form, that we barely understand.
59	It's like the number zero being animated and walking around the corridors here.
60	That would be super weird.
61	These are weirder.
62	And it's not just like a basketball that you smoosh down into a little point and it's super dense and that's weird.
63	No, smooshed basketballs have a surface.
64	These things don't have surfaces, and we know that now.
65	Because we've seen it.
66	Or the lack of it.
67	What's really interesting about black holes is that we can learn a lot about them by studying the material just as it passes through that point of no information return.
68	Because at that point, it's emitting lots of X-rays and optical and UV and radio waves.
69	We can actually learn how these objects grow.
70	And in SDSS, we're looking at over half a million supermassive black holes, to try to understand how they formed.
71	Like I said, we live in the Milky Way, you guys are all familiar with that.
72	The Milky Way is a completely average galaxy.
73	Nothing funny going on.
74	But it's ours, which is great.
75	We think that the Milky Way, and all the Milky Ways, have this really disturbing past of literally blowing themselves apart.
76	It's like every average guy you know has a history as a punk rock teenager.
77	That's very bizarre.
78	Stars are blowing up in these systems, black holes are growing at their centers and emitting a tremendous amount of energy.
79	How does that happen, how does this transformation happen?
80	And at SDSS, we're going to the bellies of the beast and zooming way in, to look at these processes where they are occurring in order to understand how Sid Vicious grows up into Ward Cleaver.
81	My arsenal.
82	These are my two big telescopes.
83	The Apache Point Observatory hosts the Sloan telescope in New Mexico, and the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile hosts the two-and-a-half-meter telescope, the du Pont.
84	Two and a half meters is the size of our mirror, which was huge for Tycho and Kepler.
85	But it's actually not so big today.
86	There are way bigger telescopes out there.
87	But in SDSS we use new instruments on these old telescopes to make them interesting.
88	We capture light from all of those objects into our aperture, and that light is then focused at the focal plane, where our instruments sit and process that light.
89	What's new in SDSS-V is that we're making the focal plane entirely robotic.
90	That's right: robots.
91	(Laughter)
92	So I'm going to show them to you, but they're fierce and terrifying, and I want you all to just take a breath.
93	(Exhales) Trigger warning.
94	And with no apologies to all the Blade Runners among you, here they are.
95	(Laughter)
96	I have 1,000 of these, 500 in the focal plane of each telescope in each hemisphere.
97	And this is how they move on the sky.
98	So these are our objects and a star field, so you've got stars, galaxies, black holes.
99	And our robots move to those objects as we pass over them in order to capture the light from those stars and galaxies and black holes, and yes, it is weird to capture black hole light, but we've already gone over that black holes are weird.
100	One more thing.
101	Stars are exploding all the time, like this one did back in 1987 in our cosmic backyard.
102	Black holes are growing all the time.
103	There is a new sky every night.
104	Which means we can't just map the sky one time.
105	We have to map the sky multiple times.
106	So in SDSS-V, we're going back to each part of the sky multiple times in order to see how these objects change over time.
107	Because those changes in time encode the physics, and they encode how these objects are growing and changing.
108	Mow the sky.
109	OK, let me just recap.
110	Global survey, two hemispheres, five telescopes, 10 spectrographs, millions of objects, mow the sky, creative army, robots, yeah.
111	"So you're thinking, ""Wow."
112	"She must have this industrial machine going, no room for the individual, curious, lone wolf genius,"" right?"
113	And you'd be 100 percent wrong.
114	Meet Hanny's Voorwerp.
115	Hanny van Arkel was a Dutch schoolteacher who was analyzing the public versions of the SDSS data, when she found this incredibly rare type of object, which is now a subject of major study.
116	She was able to do this because SDSS, since its beginning and by mandate from the Sloan Foundation, has made its data both publicly available and usable to a broad range of audiences.
117	She's a citizen — yeah, clap for that.
118	Clap for that.
119	(Applause)
120	"Hanny is a citizen scientist, or as I like to call them, ""citizen warriors."""
121	And she shows that you don't have to be a fancy astrophysicist to participate.
122	You just have to be curious.
123	"A few years ago, my four-year-old asked, ""Can moons have moons?"""
124	And I set about to answer this question because even though many four-year-olds over all of time have probably asked this question, many experts, including myself, didn't know the answer.
125	These are the moons in our solar system that can host hypothetical submoons.
126	And that just goes to show you that there are so many basic questions left to be understood.
127	And this brings me to the most important point about SDSS.
128	Because, yeah, the stars, the galaxies, the black holes, the robots — that's all super cool.
129	But the coolest thing of all is that eensy-weensy creatures on a rubble pile around a totally average star in a totally average galaxy can win the battle to understand their world.
130	Every dot in this video is a galaxy.
131	Every dot.
132	(Cheers) (Applause)
133	I'm showing here the number of galaxies that astronomers have mapped in large surveys since about 1980.
134	You can see SDSS kick in around Y2K.
135	If we stay on this line, we will map every large galaxy in the observable universe by 2060.
136	Think about that.
137	Think about it: we've gone from arranging clamshells to general relativity to SDSS in a few thousand years — and if we hang on 40 more, we can map all the galaxies.
138	But we have to stay on the line.
139	Will that be our choice?
140	There are dark forces in this world that will rob our entire species of our right to understand our universe.
141	Don't be afraid of the dark.
142	Fight back.
143	Join us.
144	Thank you.
145	(Applause)
0	Insulin pumps improve the lives of many of the 415 million people with diabetes around the world by monitoring blood sugar, delivering insulin, and preventing the need for constant finger-pricking and blood testing.
1	These small machines include a pump and a needle, which can sense glucose levels, feed back to the pump, and then calculate how much insulin to deliver through the needle.
2	But they have a catch: they’re temporary.
3	Within a few days, glucose sensors have to be moved and replaced.
4	And it’s not just glucose monitors and insulin pumps that have this problem, but all bodily implants, at different time scales.
5	Plastic prosthetic knees have to be replaced after about 20 years.
6	Other implants, such as those used for cosmetic reasons, can meet the same fate in about 10.
7	That isn’t just a nuisance: it can be expensive and risky.
8	This inconvenience happens because of our bodies’ immune systems.
9	Honed by several hundred million years of evolution, these defensive fronts have become exceptionally good at identifying foreign objects.
10	Our immune systems boast an impressive arsenal of tools to tackle, intercept, and destroy anything they believe shouldn’t be there.
11	But the consequence of this constant surveillance is that our bodies treat helpful implants, like insulin pumps, with the same suspicion as they would a harmful virus or bacteria.
12	As soon as the insulin pump has been implanted in the skin, its presence triggers what’s known as a “foreign body response.” This starts with free-floating proteins that stick themselves to the surface of the implant.
13	Those proteins include antibodies, which attempt to neutralize the new object and send out a signal that calls other immune cells to the site to strengthen the attack.
14	Early-responding inflammatory cells, like neutrophils and macrophages, respond to the emergency call.
15	Neutrophils release little granules filled with enzymes that try to break down the surface of the insulin pump’s needle.
16	Macrophages secrete enzymes too, together with nitric oxide radicals, which create a chemical reaction that degrades the object over time.
17	If the macrophages are unable to dispatch the foreign body rapidly, they fuse together, forming a mass of cells called a “giant cell.” At the same time, cells called fibroblasts travel to the site and begin to deposit layers of dense connective tissue.
18	Those enclose the needle that the pump uses to deliver insulin and test for glucose levels.
19	Over time this scaffolding builds up, forming a scar around the implant.
20	The scar functions as an almost impenetrable wall that might start to block vital interactions between the body and the implant.
21	For example, scarring around pacemakers can interrupt the electrical transmission that’s crucial for their functioning.
22	Synthetic knee joints may give off particles as they’re worn down, causing immune cells to inflame around these fragments.
23	Tragically, the immune system’s attack can even be life-threatening.
24	However, researchers are finding ways to trick the immune system into accepting the new devices we introduce into our bodily tissues.
25	We’ve discovered that coating implants with certain chemicals and drugs can dampen the immune response.
26	Those basically make the implants invisible to the immune system.
27	We’re also making more implants out of natural materials and in forms that directly mimic tissues, so that the body launches a weaker attack than it would if it came across a completely artificial implant.
28	Some medical treatments involve implants designed to regenerate lost or damaged tissues.
29	In those cases, we can design the implants to contain ingredients that will release specific signals, and carefully tailor our bodies’ immune reactions.
30	In the future, this way of working alongside the immune system could help us develop completely artificial organs, totally integrative prostheses, and self-healing wound therapies.
31	These treatments might one day revolutionize medicine– and transform, forever, the bodies we live in.
0	Computers used to be as big as a room.
1	But now they fit in your pocket, on your wrist and can even be implanted inside of your body.
2	How cool is that?
3	And this has been enabled by the miniaturization of transistors, which are the tiny switches in the circuits at the heart of our computers.
4	And it's been achieved through decades of development and breakthroughs in science and engineering and of billions of dollars of investment.
5	But it's given us vast amounts of computing, huge amounts of memory and the digital revolution that we all experience and enjoy today.
6	But the bad news is, we're about to hit a digital roadblock, as the rate of miniaturization of transistors is slowing down.
7	And this is happening at exactly the same time as our innovation in software is continuing relentlessly with artificial intelligence and big data.
8	And our devices regularly perform facial recognition or augment our reality or even drive cars down our treacherous, chaotic roads.
9	It's amazing.
10	But if we don't keep up with the appetite of our software, we could reach a point in the development of our technology where the things that we could do with software could, in fact, be limited by our hardware.
11	We've all experienced the frustration of an old smartphone or tablet grinding slowly to a halt over time under the ever-increasing weight of software updates and new features.
12	And it worked just fine when we bought it not so long ago.
13	But the hungry software engineers have eaten up all the hardware capacity over time.
14	The semiconductor industry is very well aware of this and is working on all sorts of creative solutions, such as going beyond transistors to quantum computing or even working with transistors in alternative architectures such as neural networks to make more robust and efficient circuits.
15	But these approaches will take quite some time, and we're really looking for a much more immediate solution to this problem.
16	The reason why the rate of miniaturization of transistors is slowing down is due to the ever-increasing complexity of the manufacturing process.
17	The transistor used to be a big, bulky device, until the invent of the integrated circuit based on pure crystalline silicon wafers.
18	And after 50 years of continuous development, we can now achieve transistor features dimensions down to 10 nanometers.
19	You can fit more than a billion transistors in a single square millimeter of silicon.
20	And to put this into perspective: a human hair is 100 microns across.
21	A red blood cell, which is essentially invisible, is eight microns across, and you can place 12 across the width of a human hair.
22	But a transistor, in comparison, is much smaller, at a tiny fraction of a micron across.
23	You could place more than 260 transistors across a single red blood cell or more than 3,000 across the width of a human hair.
24	It really is incredible nanotechnology in your pocket right now.
25	And besides the obvious benefit of being able to place more, smaller transistors on a chip, smaller transistors are faster switches, and smaller transistors are also more efficient switches.
26	So this combination has given us lower cost, higher performance and higher efficiency electronics that we all enjoy today.
27	To manufacture these integrated circuits, the transistors are built up layer by layer, on a pure crystalline silicon wafer.
28	And in an oversimplified sense, every tiny feature of the circuit is projected onto the surface of the silicon wafer and recorded in a light-sensitive material and then etched through the light-sensitive material to leave the pattern in the underlying layers.
29	And this process has been dramatically improved over the years to give the electronics performance we have today.
30	But as the transistor features get smaller and smaller, we're really approaching the physical limitations of this manufacturing technique.
31	The latest systems for doing this patterning have become so complex that they reportedly cost more than 100 million dollars each.
32	And semiconductor factories contain dozens of these machines.
33	So people are seriously questioning: Is this approach long-term viable?
34	But we believe we can do this chip manufacturing in a totally different and much more cost-effective way using molecular engineering and mimicking nature down at the nanoscale dimensions of our transistors.
35	As I said, the conventional manufacturing takes every tiny feature of the circuit and projects it onto the silicon.
36	But if you look at the structure of an integrated circuit, the transistor arrays, many of the features are repeated millions of times.
37	It's a highly periodic structure.
38	So we want to take advantage of this periodicity in our alternative manufacturing technique.
39	We want to use self-assembling materials to naturally form the periodic structures that we need for our transistors.
40	We do this with the materials, then the materials do the hard work of the fine patterning, rather than pushing the projection technology to its limits and beyond.
41	Self-assembly is seen in nature in many different places, from lipid membranes to cell structures, so we do know it can be a robust solution.
42	If it's good enough for nature, it should be good enough for us.
43	So we want to take this naturally occurring, robust self-assembly and use it for the manufacturing of our semiconductor technology.
44	One type of self-assemble material — it's called a block co-polymer — consists of two polymer chains just a few tens of nanometers in length.
45	But these chains hate each other.
46	They repel each other, very much like oil and water or my teenage son and daughter.
47	(Laughter)
48	But we cruelly bond them together, creating an inbuilt frustration in the system, as they try to separate from each other.
49	And in the bulk material, there are billions of these, and the similar components try to stick together, and the opposing components try to separate from each other at the same time.
50	And this has a built-in frustration, a tension in the system.
51	So it moves around, it squirms until a shape is formed.
52	And the natural self-assembled shape that is formed is nanoscale, it's regular, it's periodic, and it's long range, which is exactly what we need for our transistor arrays.
53	So we can use molecular engineering to design different shapes of different sizes and of different periodicities.
54	So for example, if we take a symmetrical molecule, where the two polymer chains are similar length, the natural self-assembled structure that is formed is a long, meandering line, very much like a fingerprint.
55	And the width of the fingerprint lines and the distance between them is determined by the lengths of our polymer chains but also the level of built-in frustration in the system.
56	And we can even create more elaborate structures if we use unsymmetrical molecules, where one polymer chain is significantly shorter than the other.
57	And the self-assembled structure that forms in this case is with the shorter chains forming a tight ball in the middle, and it's surrounded by the longer, opposing polymer chains, forming a natural cylinder.
58	And the size of this cylinder and the distance between the cylinders, the periodicity, is again determined by how long we make the polymer chains and the level of built-in frustration.
59	So in other words, we're using molecular engineering to self-assemble nanoscale structures that can be lines or cylinders the size and periodicity of our design.
60	We're using chemistry, chemical engineering, to manufacture the nanoscale features that we need for our transistors.
61	But the ability to self-assemble these structures only takes us half of the way, because we still need to position these structures where we want the transistors in the integrated circuit.
62	But we can do this relatively easily using wide guide structures that pin down the self-assembled structures, anchoring them in place and forcing the rest of the self-assembled structures to lie parallel, aligned with our guide structure.
63	For example, if we want to make a fine, 40-nanometer line, which is very difficult to manufacture with conventional projection technology, we can manufacture a 120-nanometer guide structure with normal projection technology, and this structure will align three of the 40-nanometer lines in between.
64	So the materials are doing the most difficult fine patterning.
65	"And we call this whole approach ""directed self-assembly."""
66	The challenge with directed self-assembly is that the whole system needs to align almost perfectly, because any tiny defect in the structure could cause a transistor failure.
67	And because there are billions of transistors in our circuit, we need an almost molecularly perfect system.
68	But we're going to extraordinary measures to achieve this, from the cleanliness of our chemistry to the careful processing of these materials in the semiconductor factory to remove even the smallest nanoscopic defects.
69	So directed self-assembly is an exciting new disruptive technology, but it is still in the development stage.
70	But we're growing in confidence that we could, in fact, introduce it to the semiconductor industry as a revolutionary new manufacturing process in just the next few years.
71	And if we can do this, if we're successful, we'll be able to continue with the cost-effective miniaturization of transistors, continue with the spectacular expansion of computing and the digital revolution.
72	And what's more, this could even be the dawn of a new era of molecular manufacturing.
73	How cool is that?
74	Thank you.
75	(Applause)
0	Do you remember your first kiss?
1	Or that time you burned the roof of your mouth on a hot slice of pizza?
2	What about playing tag or duck, duck, goose as a child?
3	These are all instances where we're using touch to understand something.
4	And it's the basis of haptic design.
5	"""Haptic"" means of or relating to the sense of touch."
6	And we've all been using that our entire lives.
7	I was working on my computer when my friend, seeing me hunched over typing, walked over behind me.
8	She put her left thumb into the left side of my lower back, while reaching her right index finger around to the front of my right shoulder.
9	Instinctively, I sat up straight.
10	In one quick and gentle gesture, she had communicated how to improve my posture.
11	The paper I was working on at that very moment centered around developing new ways to teach movement using technology.
12	I wanted to create a suit that could teach a person kung fu.
13	(Laughter)
14	But I had no idea how to communicate movement without an instructor being in the room.
15	And in that moment, it became crystal clear: touch.
16	If I had vibrating motors where she had placed each of her fingers, paired with motion-capture data of my current and optimal posture, I could simulate the entire experience without an instructor needing to be in the room.
17	But there was still one important part of the puzzle that was missing.
18	If I want you to raise your wrist two inches off of your lap, using vibration, how do I tell you to do that?
19	Do I put a motor at the top of your wrist, so you know to lift up?
20	Or do I put one at the bottom of your wrist, so it feels like you're being pushed up?
21	There were no readily available answers because there was no commonly agreed-upon haptic language to communicate information with.
22	So my cofounders and I set out to create that language.
23	And the first device we built was not a kung fu suit.
24	(Laughter)
25	But in a way, it was even more impressive because of its simplicity and usefulness.
26	We started with the use case of navigation, which is a simplified form of movement.
27	We then created Wayband, a wrist-wearable device that could orient a user toward a destination, using vibrating cues.
28	We would ask people to spin around and to stop in a way that they felt was the right way to go.
29	Informally, we tried this with hundreds of people, and most could figure it out within about 15 seconds.
30	It was that intuitive.
31	Initially, we were just trying to get people out of their phones and back into the real world.
32	But the more we experimented, the more we realized that those who stood to benefit most from our work were people who had little or no sight.
33	"When we first approached a blind organization, they told us, ""Don't build a blind device."
34	"Build a device that everyone can use but that's optimized for the blind experience."""
35	We created our company WearWorks with three guiding principles: make cool stuff, create the greatest impact we can in our lifetimes and reimagine an entire world designed for touch.
36	And on November 5, 2017, Wayband helped a person who was blind run the first 15 miles of the New York City Marathon without any sighted assistance.
37	(Applause)
38	It didn't get him through the entire race due to the heavy rain, but that didn't matter.
39	(Laughter)
40	We had proved the point: that it was possible to navigate a complex route using only touch.
41	So, why touch?
42	The skin has an innate sensitivity akin to the eyes' ability to recognize millions of colors or the ears' ability to recognize complex pitch and tone.
43	Yet, as a communications channel, it's been largely relegated to Morse code-like cell phone notifications.
44	If you were to suddenly receive a kiss or a punch, your reaction would be instinctive and immediate.
45	Meanwhile, your brain would be playing catch-up on the back end to understand the details of what just occurred.
46	And compared to instincts, conscious thought is pretty slow.
47	But it's a lightning bolt compared to the snail's pace of language acquisition.
48	I spent a considerable amount of time learning Spanish, Japanese, German and currently Swedish, with varying degrees of failure.
49	(Laughter)
50	But within those failures were kernels of how different languages are organized.
51	That gave our team insight into how to use the linguistic order of well-established languages as inspiration for an entirely new haptic language, one based purely on touch.
52	It also showed us when using language mechanics wasn't the best way to deliver information.
53	In the same way a smile is a smile across every culture, what if there was some underlying mechanism of touch that transcended linguistic and cultural boundaries?
54	A universal language, of sorts.
55	"You see, I could give you buzz-buzz-buzz, buzz-buzz, and you would eventually learn that that particular vibration means ""stop."""
56	But as haptic designers, we challenged ourselves.
57	"What would it be like to design ""stop?"""
58	Well, based on context, most of us have the experience of being in a vehicle and having that vehicle stop suddenly, along with our body's reaction to it.
59	So if I wanted you to stop, I could send you a vibration pattern, sure.
60	Or, I could design a haptic experience that just made stopping feel like it was the right thing to do.
61	And that takes more than an arbitrary assignment of haptic cues to meanings.
62	It takes a deep empathy.
63	It also takes the ability to distill human experience into meaningful insights and then into haptic gestures and products.
64	Haptic design is going to expand the human ability to sense and respond to our environments, both physical and virtual.
65	There's a new frontier: touch.
66	And it has the power to change how we all see the world around us.
67	Thank you.
68	(Applause)
0	I'm here to talk to you about something important that may be new to you.
1	The governments of the world are about to conduct an unintentional experiment on our climate.
2	In 2020, new rules will require ships to lower their sulfur emissions by scrubbing their dirty exhaust or switching to cleaner fuels.
3	For human health, this is really good, but sulfur particles in the emission of ships also have an effect on clouds.
4	This is a satellite image of marine clouds off the Pacific West Coast of the United States.
5	The streaks in the clouds are created by the exhaust from ships.
6	Ships' emissions include both greenhouse gases, which trap heat over long periods of time, and particulates like sulfates that mix with clouds and temporarily make them brighter.
7	Brighter clouds reflect more sunlight back to space, cooling the climate.
8	So in fact, humans are currently running two unintentional experiments on our climate.
9	In the first one, we're increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases and gradually warming the earth system.
10	This works something like a fever in the human body.
11	If the fever remains low, its effects are mild, but as the fever rises, damage grows more severe and eventually devastating.
12	We're seeing a little of this now.
13	In our other experiment, we're planning to remove a layer of particles that brighten clouds and shield us from some of this warming.
14	The effect is strongest in ocean clouds like these, and scientists expect the reduction of sulfur emissions from ships next year to produce a measurable increase in global warming.
15	Bit of a shocker?
16	In fact, most emissions contain sulfates that brighten clouds: coal, diesel exhaust, forest fires.
17	Scientists estimate that the total cooling effect from emission particles, which they call aerosols when they're in the climate, may be as much as all of the warming we've experienced up until now.
18	There's a lot of uncertainty around this effect, and it's one of the major reasons why we have difficulty predicting climate, but this is cooling that we'll lose as emissions fall.
19	So to be clear, humans are currently cooling the planet by dispersing particles into the atmosphere at massive scale.
20	We just don't know how much, and we're doing it accidentally.
21	That's worrying, but it could mean that we have a fast-acting way to reduce warming, emergency medicine for our climate fever if we needed it, and it's a medicine with origins in nature.
22	This is a NASA simulation of earth's atmosphere, showing clouds and particles moving over the planet.
23	The brightness is the Sun's light reflecting from particles in clouds, and this reflective shield is one of the primary ways that nature keeps the planet cool enough for humans and all of the life that we know.
24	In 2015, scientists assessed possibilities for rapidly cooling climate.
25	They discounted things like mirrors in space, ping-pong balls in the ocean, plastic sheets on the Arctic, and they found that the most viable approaches involved slightly increasing this atmospheric reflectivity.
26	In fact, it's possible that reflecting just one or two percent more sunlight from the atmosphere could offset two degrees Celsius or more of warming.
27	Now, I'm a technology executive, not a scientist.
28	About a decade ago, concerned about climate, I started to talk with scientists about potential countermeasures to warming.
29	These conversations grew into collaborations that became the Marine Cloud Brightening Project, which I'll talk about momentarily, and the nonprofit policy organization SilverLining, where I am today.
30	I work with politicians, researchers, members of the tech industry and others to talk about some of these ideas.
31	Early on, I met British atmospheric scientist John Latham, who proposed cooling the climate the way that the ships do, but with a natural source of particles: sea-salt mist from seawater sprayed from ships into areas of susceptible clouds over the ocean.
32	"The approach became known by the name I gave it then, ""marine cloud brightening."""
33	Early modeling studies suggested that by deploying marine cloud brightening in just 10 to 20 percent of susceptible ocean clouds, it might be possible to offset as much as two degrees Celsius's warming.
34	It might even be possible to brighten clouds in local regions to reduce the impacts caused by warming ocean surface temperatures.
35	For example, regions such as the Gulf Atlantic might be cooled in the months before a hurricane season to reduce the force of storms.
36	Or, it might be possible to cool waters flowing onto coral reefs overwhelmed by heat stress, like Australia's Great Barrier Reef.
37	But these ideas are only theoretical, and brightening marine clouds is not the only way to increase the reflection of the sunlight from the atmosphere.
38	Another occurs when large volcanoes release material with enough force to reach the upper layer of the atmosphere, the stratosphere.
39	When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, it released material into the stratosphere, including sulfates that mix with the atmosphere to reflect sunlight.
40	This material remained and circulated around the planet.
41	It was enough to cool the climate by over half a degree Celsius for about two years.
42	This cooling led to a striking increase in Arctic ice cover in 1992, which dropped in subsequent years as the particles fell back to earth.
43	But the volcanic phenomenon led Nobel Prize winner Paul Crutzen to propose the idea that dispersing particles into the stratosphere in a controlled way might be a way to counter global warming.
44	Now, this has risks that we don't understand, including things like heating up the stratosphere or damage to the ozone layer.
45	Scientists think that there could be safe approaches to this, but is this really where we are?
46	Is this really worth considering?
47	This is a simulation from the US National Center for Atmospheric Research global climate model showing, earth surface temperatures through 2100.
48	The globe on the left visualizes our current trajectory, and on the right, a world where particles are introduced into the stratosphere gradually in 2020, and maintained through 2100.
49	Intervention keeps surface temperatures near those of today, while without it, temperatures rise well over three degrees.
50	This could be the difference between a safe and an unsafe world.
51	So, if there's even a chance that this could be close to reality, is this something we should consider seriously?
52	Today, there are no capabilities, and scientific knowledge is extremely limited.
53	We don't know whether these types of interventions are even feasible, or how to characterize their risks.
54	Researchers hope to explore some basic questions that might help us know whether or not these might be real options or whether we should rule them out.
55	It requires multiple ways of studying the climate system, including computer models to forecast changes, analytic techniques like machine learning, and many types of observations.
56	And though it's controversial, it's also critical that researchers develop core technologies and perform small-scale, real-world experiments.
57	There are two research programs proposing experiments like this.
58	At Harvard, the SCoPEx experiment would release very small amounts of sulfates, calcium carbonate and water into the stratosphere with a balloon, to study chemistry and physics effects.
59	How much material?
60	Less than the amount released in one minute of flight from a commercial aircraft.
61	So this is definitely not dangerous, and it may not even be scary.
62	At the University of Washington, scientists hope to spray a fine mist of salt water into clouds in a series of land and ocean tests.
63	If those are successful, this would culminate in experiments to measurably brighten an area of clouds over the ocean.
64	The marine cloud brightening effort is the first to develop any technology for generating aerosols for atmospheric sunlight reflection in this way.
65	It requires producing very tiny particles — think about the mist that comes out of an asthma inhaler — at massive scale — so think of looking up at a cloud.
66	It's a tricky engineering problem.
67	So this one nozzle they developed generates three trillion particles per second, 80 nanometers in size, from very corrosive saltwater.
68	It was developed by a team of retired engineers in Silicon Valley — here they are — working full-time for six years, without pay, for their grandchildren.
69	It will take a few million dollars and another year or two to develop the full spray system they need to do these experiments.
70	In other parts of the world, research efforts are emerging, including small modeling programs at Beijing Normal University in China, the Indian Institute of Science, a proposed center for climate repair at Cambridge University in the UK and the DECIMALS Fund, which sponsors researchers in global South countries to study the potential impacts of these sunlight interventions in their part of the world.
71	But all of these programs, including the experimental ones, lack significant funding.
72	And understanding these interventions is a hard problem.
73	The earth is a vast, complex system and we need major investments in climate models, observations and basic science to be able to predict climate much better than we can today and manage both our accidental and any intentional interventions.
74	And it could be urgent.
75	Recent scientific reports predict that in the next few decades, earth's fever is on a path to devastation: extreme heat and fires, major loss of ocean life, collapse of Arctic ice, displacement and suffering for hundreds of millions of people.
76	The fever could even reach tipping points where warming takes over and human efforts are no longer enough to counter accelerating changes in natural systems.
77	To prevent this circumstance, the UN's International Panel on Climate Change predicts that we need to stop and even reverse emissions by 2050.
78	How?
79	We have to quickly and radically transform major economic sectors, including energy, construction, agriculture, transportation and others.
80	And it is imperative that we do this as fast as we can.
81	But our fever is now so high that climate experts say we also have to remove massive quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere, possibly 10 times all of the world's annual emissions, in ways that aren't proven yet.
82	Right now, we have slow-moving solutions to a fast-moving problem.
83	Even with the most optimistic assumptions, our exposure to risk in the next 10 to 30 years is unacceptably high, in my opinion.
84	Could interventions like these provide fast-acting medicine if we need it to reduce the earth's fever while we address its underlying causes?
85	There are real concerns about this idea.
86	Some people are very worried that even researching these interventions could provide an excuse to delay efforts to reduce emissions.
87	This is also known as a moral hazard.
88	But, like most medicines, interventions are more dangerous the more that you do, so research actually tends to draw out the fact that we absolutely, positively cannot continue to fill up the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, that these kinds of alternatives are risky and if we were to use them, we would need to use as little as possible.
89	But even so, could we ever learn enough about these interventions to manage the risk?
90	Who would make decisions about when and how to intervene?
91	What if some people are worse off, or they just think they are?
92	These are really hard problems.
93	But what really worries me is that as climate impacts worsen, leaders will be called on to respond by any means available.
94	I for one don't want them to act without real information and much better options.
95	Scientists think it will take a decade of research just to assess these interventions, before we ever were to develop or use them.
96	Yet today, the global level of investment in these interventions is effectively zero.
97	So, we need to move quickly if we want policymakers to have real information on this kind of emergency medicine.
98	There is hope!
99	The world has solved these kinds of problems before.
100	In the 1970s, we identified an existential threat to our protective ozone layer.
101	In the 1980s, scientists, politicians and industry came together in a solution to replace the chemicals causing the problem.
102	They achieved this with the only legally binding environmental agreement signed by all countries in the world, the Montreal Protocol.
103	Still in force today, it has resulted in a recovery of the ozone layer and is the most successful environmental protection effort in human history.
104	We have a far greater threat now, but we do have the ability to develop and agree on solutions to protect people and restore our climate to health.
105	This could mean that to remain safe, we reflect sunlight for a few decades, while we green our industries and remove CO2.
106	It definitely means we must work now to understand our options for this kind of emergency medicine.
107	Thank you,
108	(Applause)
0	How many decisions have been made about you today, or this week or this year, by artificial intelligence?
1	I build AI for a living so, full disclosure, I'm kind of a nerd.
2	And because I'm kind of a nerd, wherever some new news story comes out about artificial intelligence stealing all our jobs, or robots getting citizenship of an actual country, I'm the person my friends and followers message freaking out about the future.
3	We see this everywhere.
4	This media panic that our robot overlords are taking over.
5	We could blame Hollywood for that.
6	But in reality, that's not the problem we should be focusing on.
7	There is a more pressing danger, a bigger risk with AI, that we need to fix first.
8	So we are back to this question: How many decisions have been made about you today by AI?
9	And how many of these were based on your gender, your race or your background?
10	Algorithms are being used all the time to make decisions about who we are and what we want.
11	Some of the women in this room will know what I'm talking about if you've been made to sit through those pregnancy test adverts on YouTube like 1,000 times.
12	Or you've scrolled past adverts of fertility clinics on your Facebook feed.
13	Or in my case, Indian marriage bureaus.
14	(Laughter)
15	But AI isn't just being used to make decisions about what products we want to buy or which show we want to binge watch next.
16	"I wonder how you'd feel about someone who thought things like this: ""A black or Latino person is less likely than a white person to pay off their loan on time."""
17	"""A person called John makes a better programmer than a person called Mary."""
18	"""A black man is more likely to be a repeat offender than a white man."""
19	"You're probably thinking, ""Wow, that sounds like a pretty sexist, racist person,"" right?"
20	These are some real decisions that AI has made very recently, based on the biases it has learned from us, from the humans.
21	AI is being used to help decide whether or not you get that job interview; how much you pay for your car insurance; how good your credit score is; and even what rating you get in your annual performance review.
22	But these decisions are all being filtered through its assumptions about our identity, our race, our gender, our age.
23	How is that happening?
24	Now, imagine an AI is helping a hiring manager find the next tech leader in the company.
25	So far, the manager has been hiring mostly men.
26	So the AI learns men are more likely to be programmers than women.
27	And it's a very short leap from there to: men make better programmers than women.
28	We have reinforced our own bias into the AI.
29	And now, it's screening out female candidates.
30	Hang on, if a human hiring manager did that, we'd be outraged, we wouldn't allow it.
31	This kind of gender discrimination is not OK. And yet somehow, AI has become above the law, because a machine made the decision.
32	That's not it.
33	We are also reinforcing our bias in how we interact with AI.
34	How often do you use a voice assistant like Siri, Alexa or even Cortana?
35	They all have two things in common: one, they can never get my name right, and second, they are all female.
36	They are designed to be our obedient servants, turning your lights on and off, ordering your shopping.
37	You get male AIs too, but they tend to be more high-powered, like IBM Watson, making business decisions, Salesforce Einstein or ROSS, the robot lawyer.
38	So poor robots, even they suffer from sexism in the workplace.
39	(Laughter)
40	Think about how these two things combine and affect a kid growing up in today's world around AI.
41	So they're doing some research for a school project and they Google images of CEO.
42	The algorithm shows them results of mostly men.
43	And now, they Google personal assistant.
44	As you can guess, it shows them mostly females.
45	And then they want to put on some music, and maybe order some food, and now, they are barking orders at an obedient female voice assistant.
46	Some of our brightest minds are creating this technology today.
47	Technology that they could have created in any way they wanted.
48	"And yet, they have chosen to create it in the style of 1950s ""Mad Man"" secretary."
49	Yay!
50	But OK, don't worry, this is not going to end with me telling you that we are all heading towards sexist, racist machines running the world.
51	The good news about AI is that it is entirely within our control.
52	We get to teach the right values, the right ethics to AI.
53	So there are three things we can do.
54	One, we can be aware of our own biases and the bias in machines around us.
55	Two, we can make sure that diverse teams are building this technology.
56	And three, we have to give it diverse experiences to learn from.
57	I can talk about the first two from personal experience.
58	When you work in technology and you don't look like a Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk, your life is a little bit difficult, your ability gets questioned.
59	Here's just one example.
60	Like most developers, I often join online tech forums and share my knowledge to help others.
61	"And I've found, when I log on as myself, with my own photo, my own name, I tend to get questions or comments like this: ""What makes you think you're qualified to talk about AI?"""
62	"""What makes you think you know about machine learning?"""
63	So, as you do, I made a new profile, and this time, instead of my own picture, I chose a cat with a jet pack on it.
64	And I chose a name that did not reveal my gender.
65	You can probably guess where this is going, right?
66	So, this time, I didn't get any of those patronizing comments about my ability and I was able to actually get some work done.
67	And it sucks, guys.
68	I've been building robots since I was 15, I have a few degrees in computer science, and yet, I had to hide my gender in order for my work to be taken seriously.
69	So, what's going on here?
70	Are men just better at technology than women?
71	Another study found that when women coders on one platform hid their gender, like myself, their code was accepted four percent more than men.
72	So this is not about the talent.
73	This is about an elitism in AI that says a programmer needs to look like a certain person.
74	What we really need to do to make AI better is bring people from all kinds of backgrounds.
75	We need people who can write and tell stories to help us create personalities of AI.
76	We need people who can solve problems.
77	We need people who face different challenges and we need people who can tell us what are the real issues that need fixing and help us find ways that technology can actually fix it.
78	Because, when people from diverse backgrounds come together, when we build things in the right way, the possibilities are limitless.
79	And that's what I want to end by talking to you about.
80	Less racist robots, less machines that are going to take our jobs — and more about what technology can actually achieve.
81	So, yes, some of the energy in the world of AI, in the world of technology is going to be about what ads you see on your stream.
82	But a lot of it is going towards making the world so much better.
83	Think about a pregnant woman in the Democratic Republic of Congo, who has to walk 17 hours to her nearest rural prenatal clinic to get a checkup.
84	What if she could get diagnosis on her phone, instead?
85	Or think about what AI could do for those one in three women in South Africa who face domestic violence.
86	If it wasn't safe to talk out loud, they could get an AI service to raise alarm, get financial and legal advice.
87	These are all real examples of projects that people, including myself, are working on right now, using AI.
88	So, I'm sure in the next couple of days there will be yet another news story about the existential risk, robots taking over and coming for your jobs.
89	(Laughter)
90	And when something like that happens, I know I'll get the same messages worrying about the future.
91	But I feel incredibly positive about this technology.
92	This is our chance to remake the world into a much more equal place.
93	But to do that, we need to build it the right way from the get go.
94	We need people of different genders, races, sexualities and backgrounds.
95	We need women to be the makers and not just the machines who do the makers' bidding.
96	We need to think very carefully what we teach machines, what data we give them, so they don't just repeat our own past mistakes.
97	So I hope I leave you thinking about two things.
98	First, I hope you leave thinking about bias today.
99	And that the next time you scroll past an advert that assumes you are interested in fertility clinics or online betting websites, that you think and remember that the same technology is assuming that a black man will reoffend.
100	Or that a woman is more likely to be a personal assistant than a CEO.
101	And I hope that reminds you that we need to do something about it.
102	And second, I hope you think about the fact that you don't need to look a certain way or have a certain background in engineering or technology to create AI, which is going to be a phenomenal force for our future.
103	You don't need to look like a Mark Zuckerberg, you can look like me.
104	And it is up to all of us in this room to convince the governments and the corporations to build AI technology for everyone, including the edge cases.
105	And for us all to get education about this phenomenal technology in the future.
106	Because if we do that, then we've only just scratched the surface of what we can achieve with AI.
107	Thank you.
108	(Applause)
0	I get out of bed for two reasons.
1	One, small-scale family farmers need more food.
2	It's crazy that in 2019 farmers that feed us are hungry.
3	And two, science needs to be more diverse and inclusive.
4	If we're going to solve the toughest challenges on the planet, like food insecurity for the millions living in extreme poverty, it's going to take all of us.
5	I want to use the latest technology with the most diverse and inclusive teams on the planet to help farmers have more food.
6	I'm a computational biologist.
7	I know — what is that and how is it going to help end hunger?
8	Basically, I like computers and biology and somehow, putting that together is a job.
9	(Laughter)
10	I don't have a story of wanting to be a biologist from a young age.
11	The truth is, I played basketball in college.
12	And part of my financial aid package was I needed a work-study job.
13	So one random day, I wandered to the nearest building to my dorm room.
14	And it just so happens it was the biology building.
15	I went inside and looked at the job board.
16	Yes, this is pre-the-internet.
17	And I saw a three-by-five card advertising a job to work in the herbarium.
18	"I quickly took down the number, because it said ""flexible hours,"" and I needed that to work around my basketball schedule."
19	I ran to the library to figure out what an herbarium was.
20	(Laughter)
21	And it turns out an herbarium is where they store dead, dried plants.
22	I was lucky to land the job.
23	So my first scientific job was gluing dead plants onto paper for hours on end.
24	(Laughter)
25	It's so glamorous.
26	This is how I became a computational biologist.
27	During that time, genomics and computing were coming of age.
28	And I went on to do my masters combining biology and computers.
29	During that time, I worked at Los Alamos National Lab in the theoretical biology and biophysics group.
30	And it was there I had my first encounter with the supercomputer, and my mind was blown.
31	With the power of supercomputing, which is basically thousands of connected PCs on steroids, we were able to uncover the complexities of influenza and hepatitis C. And it was during this time that I saw the power of using computers and biology combined, for humanity.
32	And I wanted this to be my career path.
33	So, since 1999, I've spent the majority of my scientific career in very high-tech labs, surrounded by really expensive equipment.
34	So many ask me how and why do I work for farmers in Africa.
35	Well, because of my computing skills, in 2013, a team of East African scientists asked me to join the team in the plight to save cassava.
36	Cassava is a plant whose leaves and roots feed 800 million people globally.
37	And 500 million in East Africa.
38	So that's nearly a billion people relying on this plant for their daily calories.
39	If a small-scale family farmer has enough cassava, she can feed her family and she can sell it at the market for important things like school fees, medical expenses and savings.
40	But cassava is under attack in Africa.
41	Whiteflies and viruses are devastating cassava.
42	Whiteflies are tiny insects that feed on the leaves of over 600 plants.
43	They are bad news.
44	There are many species; they become pesticide resistant; and they transmit hundreds of plant viruses that cause cassava brown streak disease and cassava mosaic disease.
45	This completely kills the plant.
46	And if there's no cassava, there's no food or income for millions of people.
47	It took me one trip to Tanzania to realize that these women need some help.
48	These amazing, strong, small-scale family farmers, the majority women, are doing it rough.
49	They don't have enough food to feed their families, and it's a real crisis.
50	What happens is they go out and plant fields of cassava when the rains come.
51	Nine months later, there's nothing, because of these pests and pathogens.
52	And I thought to myself, how in the world can farmers be hungry?
53	So I decided to spend some time on the ground with the farmers and the scientists to see if I had any skills that could be helpful.
54	The situation on the ground is shocking.
55	The whiteflies have destroyed the leaves that are eaten for protein, and the viruses have destroyed the roots that are eaten for starch.
56	An entire growing season will pass, and the farmer will lose an entire year of income and food, and the family will suffer a long hunger season.
57	This is completely preventable.
58	If the farmer knew what variety of cassava to plant in her field, that was resistant to those viruses and pathogens, they would have more food.
59	We have all the technology we need, but the knowledge and the resources are not equally distributed around the globe.
60	So what I mean specifically is, the older genomic technologies that have been required to uncover the complexities in these pests and pathogens — these technologies were not made for sub-Saharan Africa.
61	They cost upwards of a million dollars; they require constant power and specialized human capacity.
62	These machines are few and far between on the continent, which is leaving many scientists battling on the front lines no choice but to send the samples overseas.
63	And when you send the samples overseas, samples degrade, it costs a lot of money, and trying to get the data back over weak internet is nearly impossible.
64	So sometimes it can take six months to get the results back to the farmer.
65	And by then, it's too late.
66	The crop is already gone, which results in further poverty and more hunger.
67	We knew we could fix this.
68	In 2017, we had heard of this handheld, portable DNA sequencer called an Oxford Nanopore MinION.
69	This was being used in West Africa to fight Ebola.
70	So we thought: Why can't we use this in East Africa to help farmers?
71	So, what we did was we set out to do that.
72	At the time, the technology was very new, and many doubted we could replicate this on the farm.
73	"When we set out to do this, one of our ""collaborators"" in the UK told us that we would never get that to work in East Africa, let alone on the farm."
74	So we accepted the challenge.
75	This person even went so far as to bet us two of the best bottles of champagne that we would never get that to work.
76	Two words: pay up.
77	(Laughter)
78	(Applause)
79	Pay up, because we did it.
80	We took the entire high-tech molecular lab to the farmers of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, and we called it Tree Lab.
81	So what did we do?
82	Well, first of all, we gave ourselves a team name — it's called the Cassava Virus Action Project.
83	We made a website, we gathered support from the genomics and computing communities, and away we went to the farmers.
84	Everything that we need for our Tree Lab is being carried by the team here.
85	All of the molecular and computational requirements needed to diagnose sick plants is there.
86	And it's actually all on this stage here as well.
87	We figured if we could get the data closer to the problem, and closer to the farmer, the quicker we could tell her what was wrong with her plant.
88	And not only tell her what was wrong — give her the solution.
89	And the solution is, burn the field and plant varieties that are resistant to the pests and pathogens she has in her field.
90	So the first thing that we did was we had to do a DNA extraction.
91	And we used this machine here.
92	"It's called a PDQeX, which stands for ""Pretty Damn Quick Extraction."""
93	(Laughter)
94	I know.
95	My friend Joe is really cool.
96	One of the biggest challenges in doing a DNA extraction is it usually requires very expensive equipment, and takes hours.
97	But with this machine, we've been able to do it in 20 minutes, at a fraction of the cost.
98	And this runs off of a motorcycle battery.
99	From there, we take the DNA extraction and prepare it into a library, getting it ready to load on to this portable, handheld genomic sequencer, which is here, and then we plug this into a mini supercomputer, which is called a MinIT.
100	And both of these things are plugged into a portable battery pack.
101	So we were able to eliminate the requirements of main power and internet, which are two very limiting factors on a small-scale family farm.
102	Analyzing the data quickly can also be a problem.
103	But this is where me being a computational biologist came in handy.
104	All that gluing of dead plants, and all that measuring, and all that computing finally came in handy in a real-world, real-time way.
105	I was able to make customized databases and we were able to give the farmers results in three hours versus six months.
106	(Applause)
107	The farmers were overjoyed.
108	So how do we know that we're having impact?
109	Nine moths after our Tree Lab, Asha went from having zero tons per hectare to 40 tons per hectare.
110	She had enough to feed her family and she was selling it at the market, and she's now building a house for her family.
111	Yeah, so cool.
112	(Applause)
113	So how do we scale Tree Lab?
114	The thing is, farmers are scaled already in Africa.
115	These women work in farmer groups, so helping Asha actually helped 3,000 people in her village, because she shared the results and also the solution.
116	I remember every single farmer I've ever met.
117	Their pain and their joy is engraved in my memories.
118	Our science is for them.
119	Tree Lab is our best attempt to help them become more food secure.
120	I never dreamt that the best science I would ever do in my life would be on that blanket in East Africa, with the highest-tech genomic gadgets.
121	But our team did dream that we could give farmers answers in three hours versus six months, and then we did it.
122	Because that's the power of diversity and inclusion in science.
123	Thank you.
124	(Applause)
125	(Cheers)
0	For thousands of years, well, really probably millions of years, our ancestors have looked up at the sky and wondered what's up there, and they've also started to wonder, hmm, could we be alone in this planet?
1	Now, I'm fortunate that I get to get paid to actually ask some of those questions, and sort of bad news for you, your tax dollars are paying me to try to answer some of those questions.
2	But then, about 10 years ago, I was told, I mean asked, if I would start to look at the technology to help get us off planet, and so that's what I'm going to talk to you about today.
3	So playing to the local crowd, this is what it looks like in your day-to-day life in Boston, but as you start to go off planet, things look very, very different.
4	So there we are, hovering above the WGBH studios.
5	And here's a very famous picture of the Earthrise from the Moon, and you can see the Earth starting to recede.
6	And then what I love is this picture that was taken from the surface of Mars looking back at the Earth.
7	Can anyone find the Earth?
8	I'm going to help you out a little.
9	(Laughter)
10	Yeah.
11	The point of showing this is that when people start to go to Mars, they're not going to be able to keep calling in and be micromanaged the way people on a space station are.
12	They're going to have to be independent.
13	So even though they're up there, there are going to be all sorts of things that they're going to need, just like people on Earth need things like, oh, transportation, life support, food, clothing and so on.
14	But unlike on Earth, they are also going to need oxygen.
15	They're going to have to deal with about a third of the gravity that we have here.
16	They're going to have to worry about habitats, power, heat, light and radiation protection, something that we don't actually worry about nearly as much on the Earth, because we have this beautiful atmosphere and magnetosphere.
17	The problem with that is that we also have a lot of constraints.
18	So the biggest one for us is upmass, and the number that I've used for years is it costs about 10,000 dollars to launch a can of Coke into low Earth orbit.
19	The problem is, there you are with 10,000 dollars later, and you're still in low Earth orbit.
20	You're not even at the Moon or Mars or anything else.
21	So you're going to have to try to figure out how to keep the mass as low as possible so you don't have to launch it.
22	But on top of that cost issue with the mass, you also have problems of storage and flexibility and reliability.
23	"You can't just get there and say, ""Oops, I forgot to bring,"" because Amazon.com just does not deliver to Mars."
24	So you better be prepared.
25	So what is the solution for this?
26	And I'm going to propose to you for the rest of this talk that the solution actually is life, and when you start to look at life as a technology, you realize, ah, that's it, that's exactly what we needed.
27	This plant here, like every person here and every one of your dogs and cats and plants and so on, all started as a single cell.
28	So imagine, you're starting as a very low upmass object and then growing into something a good deal bigger.
29	Now, my hero Charles Darwin, of course, reminds us that there's no such thing as a designer in biology, but what if we now have the technology to design biology, maybe even design, oh, whole new life-forms that can do things for us that we couldn't have imagined otherwise?
30	"So years ago, I was asked to start to sell this program, and while I was doing that, I was put in front of a panel at NASA, as you might sort of imagine, a bunch of people in suits and white shirts and pencil protectors, and I did this sort of crazy, wild, ""This is all the next great thing,"" and I thought they would be blown over, and instead the chairman of the committee just looked at me straight in the eye, and said, ""So what's the big idea?"""
31	"So I was like, ""OK, you want Star Trek?"
32	"We'll do Star Trek."""
33	And so let me tell you what the big idea is.
34	We've used organisms to make biomaterials for years.
35	So here's a great picture taken outside of Glasgow, and you can see lots of great biomaterials there.
36	There are trees that you could use to build houses.
37	There are sheep where you can get your wool from.
38	You could get leather from the sheep.
39	Just quickly glancing around the room, I'll bet there's no one in this room that doesn't have some kind of animal or plant product on them, some kind of biomaterial.
40	But you know what?
41	We're not going to take sheep and trees and stuff to Mars.
42	That's nuts, because of the upmass problem.
43	But we are going to take things like this.
44	This is Bacillus subtilis.
45	Those white dots that you see are spores.
46	This happens to be a bacterium that can form incredibly resistant spores, and when I say incredibly resistant, they've proven themselves.
47	Bacillus subtilis spores have been flown on what was called LDEF, Long Duration Exposure Facility, for almost six years and some of them survived that in space.
48	Unbelievable, a lot better than any of us can do.
49	So why not just take the capabilities, like to make wood or to make wool or spider silk or whatever, and put them in Bacillus subtilis spores, and take those with you off planet?
50	So what are you going to do when you're off planet?
51	Here's an iconic picture of Buzz Aldrin looking back at the Eagle when he landed, oh, it was almost 50 years ago, on the surface of the Moon.
52	Now if you're going to go to the Moon for three days and you're the first person to set foot, yeah, you can live in a tin can, but you wouldn't want to do that for, say, a year and a half.
53	So I did actually a calculation, being in California.
54	I looked at what the average size of a cell at Alcatraz is, and I have news for you, the volume in the Eagle there, in the Lunar Module, was about the size of a cell at Alcatraz if it were only five feet high.
55	So incredibly cramped living quarters.
56	You just can't ask a human to stay in there for long periods of time.
57	So why not take these biomaterials and make something?
58	So here's an image that a colleague of mine who is an architect, Chris Maurer, has done of what we've been proposing, and we'll get to the point of why I've been standing up here holding something that looks like a dried sandwich this whole lecture.
59	So we've proposed that the solution to the habitat problem on Mars could just simply lie in a fungus.
60	So I'm now probably going to turn off everyone from ever eating a mushroom again.
61	So let's talk about fungi for a second.
62	So you're probably familiar with this fruiting body of the fungus.
63	That's the mushroom.
64	But what we're interested in actually is what's beneath the surface there, the mycelium, which are these root hair-like structures that are really the main part of the mushroom.
65	Well, it turns out you can take those — there's a micrograph I did — and you can put them in a mold and give them a little food — and it doesn't take much, you can grow these things on sawdust — so this piece here was grown on sawdust, and that mycelium then will fill that structure to make something.
66	We've actually tried growing mycelium on Mars Simulant.
67	So no one's actually gone to the surface of Mars, but this is a simulated surface of Mars, and you can see those hair-like mycelia out there.
68	It's really amazing stuff.
69	How strong can you make these things?
70	Well, you know, I could give you numbers and tests and so on, but I think that's probably the best way to describe it.
71	There's one of my students proving that you can do this.
72	To do this, then, you've got to figure out how to put it in context.
73	How's this actually going to happen?
74	I mean, this is a great idea, Lynn, but how are you going to get from here to there?
75	So what we're saying is you grow up the mycelium in the lab, for example and then you fill up a little structure, maybe a house-like structure that's tiny, that is maybe a double-bagged sort of plastic thing, like an inflatable — I sort of think L.L.Bean when I see this.
76	And then you put it in a rocket ship and you send it off to Mars.
77	Rocket lands, you release the bag and you add a little water, and voila, you've got your habitat.
78	You know, how cool would that be?
79	And the beauty of that is you don't have to take something prebuilt.
80	And so our estimates are that we could save 90 percent of the mass that NASA is currently proposing by taking up a big steel structure if we actually grow it on site.
81	So let me give you another big idea.
82	What about digital information?
83	What's really interesting is you have a physical link to your parents and they have a physical link to their parents, and so on, all the way back to the origin of life.
84	You have never broken that continuum.
85	But the fact is that we can do that today.
86	"So we have students every day in our labs — students in Boston even do this — that make up DNA sequences and they hit the ""send"" button and they send them to their local DNA synthesis company."
87	Now once you break that physical link where you're sending it across town, it doesn't matter if you're sending it across the Charles River or if you're sending that information to Mars.
88	You've broken that physical link.
89	So then, once you're on Mars, or across the river or wherever, you can take that digital information, synthesize the physical DNA, put it maybe in another organism and voila, you've got new capabilities there.
90	So again, you've broken that physical link.
91	That's huge.
92	What about chemistry?
93	Biology does chemistry for us on Earth, and again has for literally thousands of years.
94	I bet virtually everyone in this room has eaten something today that has been made by biology doing chemistry.
95	Let me give you a big hint there.
96	What about another idea?
97	What about using DNA itself to make a wire?
98	Because again, we're trying to miniaturize everything.
99	DNA is really cheap.
100	Strawberries have a gazillion amount of DNA.
101	You know, you could take a strawberry with you, isolate the DNA, and one of my students has figured out a way to take DNA and tweak it a little bit so that you can incorporate silver atoms in very specific places, thus making an electrical wire.
102	How cool is that?
103	So while we're on the subject of metals, we're going to need to use metals for things like integrated circuits.
104	Probably we're going to want it for some structures, and so on.
105	And things like integrated circuits ultimately go bad.
106	We could talk a lot about that, but I'm going to leave it at that, that they do go bad, and so where are you going to get those metals?
107	Yeah, you could try to mine them with heavy equipment, but you get that upmass problem.
108	And I always tell people, the best way to find the metals for a new cell phone is in a dead cell phone.
109	So what if you take biology as the technology to get these metals out?
110	And how do you do this?
111	Well, take a look at the back of a vitamin bottle and you'll get an idea of all the sorts of metals that we actually use in our bodies.
112	So we have a lot of proteins as well as other organisms that can actually specifically bind metals.
113	So what if we now take those proteins and maybe attach them to this fungal mycelium and make a filter so we can start to pull those metals out in a very specific way without big mining equipment, and, even better, we've actually got a proof of concept where we've then taken those metals that we pulled out with proteins and reprinted an integrated circuit using a plasma printer.
114	Again, how cool?
115	Electricity: I was asked by a head of one of the NASA centers if you could ever take chemical energy and turn that into electrical energy.
116	Well, the great news is it's not just the electric eel that does it.
117	Everybody in this room who is still alive and functioning is doing that.
118	Part of the food that you've eaten today has gone to operate the nerve cells in your body.
119	But even other organisms, nonsentient ones, are creating electric energy, even bacteria.
120	Some bacteria are very good at making little wires.
121	So if we can harvest that ability of turning chemical energy into electrical energy, again, how cool would that be?
122	So here are some of the big ideas we talked about.
123	Let me try one more: life 2.0.
124	So for example, all of the sugars in our body are right-handed.
125	Why shouldn't we make an organism with left-handed sugars?
126	Why not make an organism that can do things that no organism can do today?
127	So organisms normally have evolved to live in very specific environments.
128	So here's this lion cub literally up a tree, and I took a picture of him a bit later, and he was a lot happier when he was down on the ground.
129	So organisms are designed for specific environments.
130	But what if you can go back to that idea of synthetic biology and tweak 'em around?
131	So here is one of our favorite places in Yellowstone National Park.
132	This is Octopus Springs.
133	If you tilt your head a little bit, it sort of looks like a body and tentacles coming out.
134	It's above the boiling temperature of water.
135	Those organisms that you see on the edge and the colors actually match the temperatures that are there, very, very high-temperature thermophiles.
136	So why not take organisms that can live at extremes, whether it's high temperature or low temperature or low pH or high pH or high salt or high levels of radiation, and take some of those capabilities and put it into other organisms.
137	"And this is a project that my students have called, and I love this, the ""hell cell."""
138	And so we've done that.
139	We've taken organisms and sort of tweaked them and pushed them to the edges.
140	And this is important for getting us off planet and also for understanding what life is like in the universe.
141	So let me give you just a couple of final thoughts.
142	First is this whole idea that we have all these needs for human settlement off planet that are in some ways exactly like we have on the Earth, that we need the food and we need the shelter and so on, but we have very, very different constraints of this upmass problem and the reliability and the flexibility and so on.
143	But because we have these constraints that you don't have here, where you might have to think about the indigenous petrochemical industry, or whatever, you now have constraints that have to unleash creativity.
144	And once you unleash this creativity because you have the new constraints, you're forcing game-changing technological advances that you wouldn't have gotten any other way.
145	Finally, we have to think a little bit, is it a good idea to tinker around with life?
146	Well, the sort of easy answer to that is that probably no one in the room keeps a wolf cub at home, but you might have a puppy or a dog; you probably didn't eat teosinte this summer, but you ate corn.
147	We have been doing genetic modification with organisms for literally 10,000 or more years.
148	This is a different approach, but to say all of a sudden humans should never touch an organism is kinda silly because we have that capability now to do things that are far more beneficial for the planet Earth and for life beyond that.
149	And so then the question is, should we?
150	And of course I feel that not only should we, at least for getting off Earth, but actually if we don't use synthetic biology, we will never solve this upmass problem.
151	So once you think of life as a technology, you've got the solution.
152	"And so, with that, I'd like to finish the way I always finish, and say ""ad astra,"" which means, ""to the stars."""
153	Thank you very much, Boston.
154	(Applause)
0	Yes, it's dark.
1	I'm wondering how long we can all stand it without picking up our phone and turning the flashlights on.
2	Seconds?
3	Minutes?
4	A whole hour?
5	Don't worry, I'm not going to give you my whole speech in the dark.
6	But it's something I'm used to.
7	For more than 10 years, I and two million people back home have been living in darkness, locked between two borders that are nearly impossible to leave, literally, in an area that spans 25 miles long and about five miles wide.
8	I am Palestinian, and I am from Gaza.
9	I grew up there and I still live there.
10	In Gaza, we have a whole lot of nothing.
11	And I aim to create something from that nothing.
12	When a community is cut off from the world, all that we need to do is ... what?
13	To think outside the box.
14	Way outside the box.
15	That thinking led me to two projects to address two serious issues in my community.
16	The need for building materials and the need for electricity and energy.
17	Two essential ingredients of life.
18	Both are in lack of supply in Gaza.
19	First, I'm not here ... just to talk about the occupation we have back home.
20	The siege, the wars, the bombs, the protests or the death toll.
21	I am here because I wanted to show that we can live through it all.
22	I am here because I wanted to make a change.
23	I am here to tell you that I am a statistic that cannot be ignored.
24	In the 2014 war, thousands of houses were destroyed.
25	Those houses were made from sunbaked stones and blocks.
26	Those houses stood for decades and decades.
27	Those houses were for my family, friends, neighbors, everyone I know.
28	At that time, I asked myself a question: What can I do for people?
29	How can I help them?
30	I knew we weren't able to get cement, aggregate and sand to rebuild what the war destroyed.
31	But also, maybe we can use something from inside the community, something we already had.
32	I started to put things together.
33	First, paper as a filler, instead of the aggregate we import.
34	But that did not work out.
35	What about using glass powder to replace part of the cement?
36	But that failed, too.
37	I guessed making building blocks out of mud would be a great idea.
38	But unfortunately, it didn't work out.
39	During the process of burning the mud blocks, we had a huge amount of ashes.
40	"And I was like, ""Why don't we use those ashes?"""
41	The idea flashed in my mind.
42	"""Let's use it and combine it with the rubble of the demolished houses and make building blocks out of it."""
43	After more than 150 failed experiments, and over six months of research, I actually made it.
44	(Applause)
45	I created a building block out of the ashes and rubble of the demolished houses.
46	It's here, it came all the way with me.
47	Well, it came before me.
48	So, it's lighter, it's cheaper, and it's stronger.
49	(Applause)
50	"This building block — of course, you ask yourself, ""How did this girl do it?"""
51	It's not that hard, and it's not that easy.
52	First, we collected rubble from all around the Gaza Strip.
53	Then we combined it with the ashes that came from the landfills.
54	When the recipe is done, it's time for baking.
55	So we mold the blocks, as you can see in the photo, and we cure it using water steam.
56	"I call the material ""Green Cake,"" and people now can use it not only to rebuild old houses, but also to build new complete structures."
57	Green Cake so far has created jobs for more than 30 people.
58	And we were able to rebuild around 50 apartments, each one of them the size of a household almost for eight people.
59	We also trained fresh graduates, female and male, which is not very common in the community.
60	And we got several awards, locally and globally.
61	This block is not just only a building block.
62	It changed the stereotype about women in Gaza that stated this type of work is meant for men.
63	Education is the strongest weapon we have to fight for our freedom, decent life and future.
64	My background helped me to do this block.
65	I went to the Islamic University of Gaza, and I studied civil engineering, where there was a one-to-six female-to-male ratio.
66	Everyone told me I would end up without a job.
67	I went for a major that's meant for men.
68	But their lack of encouragement did not deter me; it inspired me.
69	(Applause)
70	After this long journey with the block, and after two years, what Gaza does need is not just building blocks.
71	We also need electricity, we need the energy.
72	I developed a new company called SunBox.
73	SunBox is a smart solar kit that we source from China, and we engineer it to fit the market need.
74	It powers not only light, but also laptops, phones, internet connection, a fan or a TV.
75	We teach local vendors and technicians to sell, install and provide customer services for people.
76	We got the project off the ground by providing 15 families with solar energy.
77	One of the solar units we installed in a refugee camp.
78	The next day I came to check what happened with the solar, and I found a whole neighborhood watching a football match using our device.
79	"I was like, ""Wow, that's going to create a huge impact in the community."""
80	That encouraged us to go to the second round of bringing 200 units.
81	But each unit costs around 350 dollars.
82	And a Palestinian family can't afford the 350 dollars.
83	So we had to think, again, outside the box: How can we make this happen?
84	If a whole neighborhood can watch a football match using one device, it means two, three and four families can share one device and enjoy the electricity.
85	"What we did is, we created a new business model called ""sharing is caring."""
86	(Laughter)
87	The sharing is caring business model says two families share one unit, three families share one unit, and they split the cost, so they can afford paying for it.
88	Well, the idea caught on.
89	I didn't expect that, but it just happened.
90	In less than two weeks, we were able to provide over 200 people with electricity.
91	(Applause)
92	And the question here: How did the idea catch on?
93	We went to community centers — those are places, you know for whom?
94	Only for men.
95	So it was so weird for a woman to go there.
96	"And I told them, ""We have a great idea."
97	"We will give you electricity, you give us people who need this electricity."""
98	Now, families are approaching us from all around the Gaza Strip.
99	"I received a phone call from the team this morning, saying, ""Majd, please, we are under pressure, we work 16 hours a day, we will not be able to work like this."
100	Families are calling us every second.
101	"They want solar energy."""
102	"Muna, from one of the families we installed the solar unit for, she told me, ""You know, Majd, I've never imagined I will control something in my life."
103	Now I can control my source of energy.
104	"I feel so special."""
105	What you take for granted is a privilege for others.
106	People like Muna.
107	She doesn't want to fight.
108	She doesn't want to stay in a bad life.
109	She's only looking for a better life.
110	Our vision, or I would say, everyone's vision in Gaza — which I am very privileged to represent the people back home — is to have a good life, a future.
111	We need to build the infrastructure of hope.
112	We want to tell them it's possible to happen, it's possible to be treated as a human being.
113	I don't have to cross four borders to come here.
114	I can just go to the airport, see the people outside, see what the world looks like.
115	Thank you so much.
116	(Applause)
0	Recently, the leadership team of an American supermarket chain decided that their business needed to get a lot more efficient.
1	So they embraced their digital transformation with zeal.
2	Out went the teams supervising meat, veg, bakery, and in came an algorithmic task allocator.
3	Now, instead of people working together, each employee went, clocked in, got assigned a task, did it, came back for more.
4	This was scientific management on steroids, standardizing and allocating work.
5	It was super efficient.
6	Well, not quite, because the task allocator didn't know when a customer was going to drop a box of eggs, couldn't predict when some crazy kid was going to knock over a display, or when the local high school decided that everybody needed to bring in coconuts the next day.
7	(Laughter)
8	Efficiency works really well when you can predict exactly what you're going to need.
9	But when the anomalous or unexpected comes along — kids, customers, coconuts — well, then efficiency is no longer your friend.
10	This has become a really crucial issue, this ability to deal with the unexpected, because the unexpected is becoming the norm.
11	It's why experts and forecasters are reluctant to predict anything more than 400 days out.
12	Why?
13	Because over the last 20 or 30 years, much of the world has gone from being complicated to being complex — which means that yes, there are patterns, but they don't repeat themselves regularly.
14	It means that very small changes can make a disproportionate impact.
15	And it means that expertise won't always suffice, because the system just keeps changing too fast.
16	So what that means is that there's a huge amount in the world that kind of defies forecasting now.
17	It's why the Bank of England will say yes, there will be another crash, but we don't know why or when.
18	We know that climate change is real, but we can't predict where forest fires will break out, and we don't know which factories are going to flood.
19	It's why companies are blindsided when plastic straws and bags and bottled water go from staples to rejects overnight, and baffled when a change in social mores turns stars into pariahs and colleagues into outcasts: ineradicable uncertainty.
20	In an environment that defies so much forecasting, efficiency won't just not help us, it specifically undermines and erodes our capacity to adapt and respond.
21	So if efficiency is no longer our guiding principle, how should we address the future?
22	What kind of thinking is really going to help us?
23	What sort of talents must we be sure to defend?
24	I think that, where in the past we used to think a lot about just in time management, now we have to start thinking about just in case, preparing for events that are generally certain but specifically remain ambiguous.
25	One example of this is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, CEPI.
26	We know there will be more epidemics in future, but we don't know where or when or what.
27	So we can't plan.
28	But we can prepare.
29	So CEPI's developing multiple vaccines for multiple diseases, knowing that they can't predict which vaccines are going to work or which diseases will break out.
30	So some of those vaccines will never be used.
31	That's inefficient.
32	But it's robust, because it provides more options, and it means that we don't depend on a single technological solution.
33	Epidemic responsiveness also depends hugely on people who know and trust each other.
34	But those relationships take time to develop, time that is always in short supply when an epidemic breaks out.
35	So CEPI is developing relationships, friendships, alliances now knowing that some of those may never be used.
36	That's inefficient, a waste of time, perhaps, but it's robust.
37	You can see robust thinking in financial services, too.
38	In the past, banks used to hold much less capital than they're required to today, because holding so little capital, being too efficient with it, is what made the banks so fragile in the first place.
39	Now, holding more capital looks and is inefficient.
40	But it's robust, because it protects the financial system against surprises.
41	Countries that are really serious about climate change know that they have to adopt multiple solutions, multiple forms of renewable energy, not just one.
42	The countries that are most advanced have been working for years now, changing their water and food supply and healthcare systems, because they recognize that by the time they have certain prediction, that information may very well come too late.
43	You can take the same approach to trade wars, and many countries do.
44	Instead of depending on a single huge trading partner, they try to be everybody's friends, because they know they can't predict which markets might suddenly become unstable.
45	It's time-consuming and expensive, negotiating all these deals, but it's robust because it makes their whole economy better defended against shocks.
46	It's particularly a strategy adopted by small countries that know they'll never have the market muscle to call the shots, so it's just better to have too many friends.
47	But if you're stuck in one of these organizations that's still kind of captured by the efficiency myth, how do you start to change it?
48	Try some experiments.
49	In the Netherlands, home care nursing used to be run pretty much like the supermarket: standardized and prescribed work to the minute: nine minutes on Monday, seven minutes on Wednesday, eight minutes on Friday.
50	The nurses hated it.
51	So one of them, Jos de Blok, proposed an experiment.
52	Since every patient is different, and we don't quite know exactly what they'll need, why don't we just leave it to the nurses to decide?
53	Sound reckless?
54	(Laughter)
55	(Applause)
56	In his experiment, Jos found the patients got better in half the time, and costs fell by 30 percent.
57	"When I asked Jos what had surprised him about his experiment, he just kind of laughed and he said, ""Well, I had no idea it could be so easy to find such a huge improvement, because this isn't the kind of thing you can know or predict sitting at a desk or staring at a computer screen."""
58	So now this form of nursing has proliferated across the Netherlands and around the world.
59	But in every new country it still starts with experiments, because each place is slightly and unpredictably different.
60	Of course, not all experiments work.
61	Jos tried a similar approach to the fire service and found it didn't work because the service is just too centralized.
62	Failed experiments look inefficient, but they're often the only way you can figure out how the real world works.
63	So now he's trying teachers.
64	Experiments like that require creativity and not a little bravery.
65	In England — I was about to say in the UK, but in England —
66	(Laughter)
67	(Applause)
68	In England, the leading rugby team, or one of the leading rugby teams, is Saracens.
69	The manager and the coach there realized that all the physical training they do and the data-driven conditioning that they do has become generic; really, all the teams do exactly the same thing.
70	So they risked an experiment.
71	They took the whole team away, even in match season, on ski trips and to look at social projects in Chicago.
72	This was expensive, it was time-consuming, and it could be a little risky putting a whole bunch of rugby players on a ski slope, right?
73	(Laughter)
74	But what they found was that the players came back with renewed bonds of loyalty and solidarity.
75	"And now when they're on the pitch under incredible pressure, they manifest what the manager calls ""poise"" — an unflinching, unwavering dedication to each other."
76	Their opponents are in awe of this, but still too in thrall to efficiency to try it.
77	At a London tech company, Verve, the CEO measures just about everything that moves, but she couldn't find anything that made any difference to the company's productivity.
78	"So she devised an experiment that she calls ""Love Week"": a whole week where each employee has to look for really clever, helpful, imaginative things that a counterpart does, call it out and celebrate it."
79	It takes a huge amount of time and effort; lots of people would call it distracting.
80	But it really energizes the business and makes the whole company more productive.
81	Preparedness, coalition-building, imagination, experiments, bravery — in an unpredictable age, these are tremendous sources of resilience and strength.
82	They aren't efficient, but they give us limitless capacity for adaptation, variation and invention.
83	And the less we know about the future, the more we're going to need these tremendous sources of human, messy, unpredictable skills.
84	But in our growing dependence on technology, we're asset-stripping those skills.
85	Every time we use technology to nudge us through a decision or a choice or to interpret how somebody's feeling or to guide us through a conversation, we outsource to a machine what we could, can do ourselves, and it's an expensive trade-off.
86	The more we let machines think for us, the less we can think for ourselves.
87	The more —
88	(Applause)
89	The more time doctors spend staring at digital medical records, the less time they spend looking at their patients.
90	The more we use parenting apps, the less we know our kids.
91	The more time we spend with people that we're predicted and programmed to like, the less we can connect with people who are different from ourselves.
92	And the less compassion we need, the less compassion we have.
93	What all of these technologies attempt to do is to force-fit a standardized model of a predictable reality onto a world that is infinitely surprising.
94	What gets left out?
95	Anything that can't be measured — which is just about everything that counts.
96	(Applause)
97	Our growing dependence on technology risks us becoming less skilled, more vulnerable to the deep and growing complexity of the real world.
98	Now, as I was thinking about the extremes of stress and turbulence that we know we will have to confront, I went and I talked to a number of chief executives whose own businesses had gone through existential crises, when they teetered on the brink of collapse.
99	These were frank, gut-wrenching conversations.
100	Many men wept just remembering.
101	"So I asked them: ""What kept you going through this?"""
102	And they all had exactly the same answer.
103	"""It wasn't data or technology,"" they said."
104	"""It was my friends and my colleagues who kept me going."""
105	"One added, ""It was pretty much the opposite of the gig economy."""
106	"But then I went and I talked to a group of young, rising executives, and I asked them, ""Who are your friends at work?"""
107	And they just looked blank.
108	"""There's no time."""
109	"""They're too busy."""
110	"""It's not efficient."""
111	Who, I wondered, is going to give them imagination and stamina and bravery when the storms come?
112	Anyone who tries to tell you that they know the future is just trying to own it, a spurious kind of manifest destiny.
113	The harder, deeper truth is that the future is uncharted, that we can't map it till we get there.
114	But that's OK, because we have so much imagination — if we use it.
115	We have deep talents of inventiveness and exploration — if we apply them.
116	We are brave enough to invent things we've never seen before.
117	Lose those skills, and we are adrift.
118	But hone and develop them, we can make any future we choose.
119	Thank you.
120	(Applause)
0	Last summer, I was hiking through the Austrian mountains.
1	And there, on top, I saw this beautiful, stone, remote hut, and it had solar panels on it.
2	And every time I see solar panels, I get very enthusiastic.
3	It's this technology that takes sunlight, which is free and available, and turns that into electricity.
4	So this hut, in the middle of nowhere, on a beautiful location, was self-sufficient.
5	But why do solar panels always have to be so ugly?
6	(Laughter)
7	My name is Marjan Van Aubel and I'm a solar designer.
8	I work in the triangle of design, sustainability and technology.
9	I strive for extreme efficiency, meaning that I develop materials that expand in size or work with solar cells that use the properties of colors to generate electricity.
10	My work is in museums all over the world, such as MoMA.
11	And, I mean, it all went quite well, but it always felt that something was missing.
12	"And it was, until I read the book called the ""Solar Revolution,"" where it says that within one hour we receive enough sunlight to provide the world with enough electricity for an entire year."
13	One hour.
14	And since then, I realized I just want to focus on solar.
15	Scientists all over the world have been focusing on making solar panels more efficient and cheaper.
16	So the price of solar has dropped enormously.
17	And this is because China started producing them on a large scale.
18	And also their efficiency has increased a lot.
19	They now even have an efficiency of 44.5 percent.
20	But if you think about the image of solar cells, it's kind of stayed the same for the last 60 years.
21	It's still this technology just stacked onto something.
22	And solar cells need to be much better integrated into our environment.
23	Climate change is the biggest problem of our time.
24	And we can't rely on the others — the government, the engineers — to make positive changes.
25	We all can contribute towards change.
26	Like I said, I'm a designer and I would like to change things through design.
27	Let me give you some examples of my work.
28	I'm collaborating with Swarovski, the crystal company.
29	And if you cut crystals in a certain way, you are able to bend and direct the light onto a certain place.
30	So I use these crystals to focus the light onto a solar panel, making them more efficient, but using aesthetics.
31	So you take the solar crystal with you in the light, there's a battery in the solar cell, you put it in a docking station and you are able to power these chandeliers.
32	So you're literally bringing the light indoors.
33	I got completely hooked on solar when I came across this technology called dye-sensitized solar cells, colored solar cells, and they are based on photosynthesis in plants.
34	Where the green chlorophyl converts light into sugar for plants, these cells convert light into electricity.
35	The best thing is, they even work indoors.
36	So different colors have different efficiency, depending on their place on the color spectrum.
37	So, for example, red is more efficient than blue.
38	So if I hear this as a designer: a colored surface, a glass colored surface, color that's mostly just used for esthetics, now gets an extra function and is able to harvest electricity, I think, where can we apply this, then?
39	This is Current Table, where the whole tabletop consists of these colored solar cells.
40	There are batteries in the legs where you can charge your phone through USB ports.
41	And in my work, it's always very important, the balance between efficiency and aesthetics.
42	So that's why the table is orange, because it is a very stable color for indoors.
43	"And this is always the most asked question I get: ""OK, great, but how many phones can I charge from this, then?"""
44	"And before I go to this complicated answer of like, ""Well, where is the table, does it have enough light, is it next to a window?"""
45	The table now has sensors that read the light intensity of the room.
46	So through an app we developed you can literally follow how much light it's getting, and how full the battery is.
47	I'm actually proud, because yesterday we installed a table at Stichting Doen's offices in Amsterdam and, right at this moment, our Queen Maxima is charging a phone from this table.
48	It's cool.
49	(Applause)
50	So the more surface you have, the more energy you can harvest.
51	These are Current Windows, where we replaced all windows in a gallery in London, in Soho, with this modern version of stained glass.
52	So people from the street could come and charge their phones through the window ledges.
53	So I'm giving extra functions to objects.
54	A window doesn't have to be just a window anymore.
55	It can also function as a little power station.
56	So, here I am, talking about how much I love solar, but I don't have solar panels on my roof.
57	I live in the center of Amsterdam, I don't own the house and it's a monument, so it's not possible and not allowed.
58	So how can you make solar cells more accessible and for everyone, and not only for the people that can afford a sustainable lifestyle?
59	We now have the opportunity to integrate solar on the place where we directly need it.
60	And there are so many amazing technologies out there.
61	If I look around now, I see every surface as an opportunity.
62	For example, I was driving in the train through the Westland, the area in the Netherlands with all the greenhouses.
63	There I saw all this glass and thought, what if we integrate those with transparent solar glass?
64	What if we integrate traditional farming that requires a lot of energy together with high-tech and combine those?
65	With this idea in mind, I created Power Plant.
66	I had a team of architects and engineers, but let me first explain how it works.
67	We use transparent solar glass to power its indoor climate.
68	We use hydroponics that pumps around nutrified water, saving 90 percent of water usage.
69	By stacking up in layers, you are able to grow more yield per square meter.
70	Extra light, besides sunlight, coming from these colored LED lights also enhances plant growth.
71	As more and more people will live in big cities, by placing Power Plants on the rooftops you don't have to fly it in from the other side of the world, you are able to grow it on the location itself.
72	Well, the big dream is to build these in off-grid places — where there's no access to water, electricity — as an independent ecosystem.
73	For this year's Design Biennial, I created the first four-meter high model of the power plant, so you could come in and experience how plants grow.
74	So it's a double harvest of sunlight, so both for the solar cells and for the plants.
75	It's like a future botanical garden, where we celebrate all these modern technologies.
76	"And the biggest compliment I got was, ""But where are the solar panels?"""
77	And that's when I think design really works, when it becomes invisible and you don't notice it.
78	I believe in solar democracy: solar energy for everyone, everywhere.
79	My aim is to make all surfaces productive.
80	I want to build houses where all the windows, curtains, walls, even floors are harvesting electricity.
81	Think about this on a big scale: in cities, there are so many surfaces.
82	The sun is still available for everyone.
83	And by integrating solar on the place where we need it, we now have the opportunity to make solar cells accessible for everyone.
84	I want to bring solar close to the people with you, but beautiful and well designed.
85	Thank you.
0	In 2008, archeologists uncovered two 9,000-year old skeletons.
1	There’s no definitive way of knowing what killed these ancient people, but we do know their bones were infected by an all too familiar bacterium.
2	The ancient Greeks knew its consumptive effects as phthisis; the Incans called it chaky oncay; and the English called it tuberculosis.
3	Today, tuberculosis, or TB, is still one of the world’s biggest infectious killers, causing more deaths than malaria or even HIV and AIDS.
4	But what exactly is this disease, and how has this pathogen persisted for so long?
5	Typically, TB bacteria called mycobacterium tuberculosis, are airborne.
6	They travel into our airways and infect our lungs.
7	Here, immune cells called macrophages rush to the infection site, attempting to absorb and break down the bacterial invaders.
8	In many cases, this response is enough to remove the bacteria.
9	But in individuals with other medical conditions– ranging from malnutrition and HIV to diabetes and pregnancy –the immune response may not be strong enough to destroy the intruder.
10	If so, mycobacterium tuberculosis will reproduce inside those macrophages, and form colonies in the surrounding lung tissue.
11	As they infect more cells, the bacteria employ cell-degrading enzymes that destroy the infected tissue, triggering chest pain, and causing patients to cough up blood.
12	The damage to the lungs leads to oxygen deprivation.
13	This begins a flood of hormonal changes– including a decrease in appetite and iron production.
14	From here, microbes can spread to the skeletal system, causing back pain and difficulty moving; to the kidneys and intestines, causing abdominal pain; and to the brain, causing headaches and even impaired consciousness.
15	These symptoms produce the classic image of TB: weight loss, a hacking, bloody cough, and ashen skin.
16	This ghostly appearance earned TB the title of the ‘White Plague’ in Victorian-era England.
17	During this period, tuberculosis was considered a ‘romantic disease,' because it tended to affect poverty- stricken artists and poets– those with weaker immune systems.
18	TB’s outward symptoms even helped fuel the popular myth of vampirism.
19	In spite of– or perhaps because of these less than scientific concerns, this period also marked the first strides toward curing TB.
20	In 1882, the German physician Robert Koch identified the disease’s bacterial origins.
21	13 years later, physicist Wilhelm Roentgen  discovered the X-ray, enabling physicians to diagnose and track its progression through the body.
22	These techniques allowed researchers to develop reliable and effective vaccines– first for smallpox, and again in 1921, when scientists developed the BCG vaccine to battle TB.
23	These developments laid the groundwork for the modern field of antibiotics– currently home to our most effective TB treatments.
24	But, antibiotics fail to address a major diagnostic complication: about 90% of people infected with TB don’t show any symptoms.
25	In these latent infections, the TB bacterium may be dormant, only activating when someone’s immune system is too weak to mount a defense.
26	This makes TB much harder to diagnose.
27	And even when properly identified, traditional treatments can take up to 9 months, requiring multiple drugs and a high potential for side effects.
28	This discourages people from finishing the full course, and partial treatment enables bacteria to develop resistance to these drugs.
29	Today, the disease is still prevalent in 30 countries, most of which face other health crises that exacerbate TB and trigger latent cases.
30	Worse still, accessing treatment can be difficult in many of these countries, and the stigma towards TB can discourage people from getting the help they need.
31	Health experts agree we need to develop better diagnostics, faster acting antibiotics, and more effective vaccines.
32	Researchers have already developed a urine test that yields results in 12 hours, as well as a new oral treatment that could cut treatment time by 75%.
33	Hopefully, with advancements like these, we’ll finally be able to make TB exclusively a thing of the past.
0	"I am an astrodynamicist — you know, like that guy Rich Purnell in the movie ""The Martian."""
1	And it's my job to study and predict motion of objects in space.
2	Currently we track about one percent of hazardous objects on orbit — hazardous to services like location, agriculture, banking, television and communications, and soon — very soon — even the internet itself.
3	Now these services are not protected from, roughly, half a million objects the size of a speck of paint all the way to a school bus in size.
4	A speck of paint, traveling at the right speed, impacting one of these objects, could render it absolutely useless.
5	But we can't track things as small as a speck of paint.
6	We can only track things as small as say, a smartphone.
7	So of this half million objects that we should be concerned about, we can only track about 26,000 of these objects.
8	And of these 26,000, only 2,000 actually work.
9	Everything else is garbage.
10	That's a lot of garbage.
11	To make things a little bit worse, most of what we launch into orbit never comes back.
12	We send the satellite in orbit, it stops working, it runs out of fuel, and we send something else up ... and then we send up something else ... and then something else.
13	And every once in a while, two of these things will collide with each other or one of these things will explode, or even worse, somebody might just happen to destroy one of their satellites on orbit, and this generates many, many more pieces, most of which also never come back.
14	Now these things are not just randomly scattered in orbit.
15	It turns out that given the curvature of space-time, there are ideal locations where we put some of these satellites — think of these as space highways.
16	Very much like highways on earth, these space highways can only take up a maximum capacity of traffic to sustain space-safe operations.
17	Unlike highways on earth, there are actually no space traffic rules.
18	None whatsoever, OK?
19	Wow.
20	What could possibly go wrong with that?
21	(Laughter)
22	Now, what would be really nice is if we had something like a space traffic map, like a Waze for space that I could look up and see what the current traffic conditions are in space, maybe even predict these.
23	"The problem with that, however, is that ask five different people, ""What's going on in orbit?"
24	"Where are things going?"""
25	and you're probably going to get 10 different answers.
26	Why is that?
27	It's because information about things on orbit is not commonly shared either.
28	So what if we had a globally accessible, open and transparent space traffic information system that can inform the public of where everything is located to try to keep space safe and sustainable?
29	And what if the system could be used to form evidence-based norms of behavior — these space traffic rules?
30	So I developed ASTRIAGraph, the world's first crowdsourced, space traffic monitoring system at the University of Texas at Austin.
31	ASTRIAGraph combines multiple sources of information from around the globe — government, industry and academia — and represents this in a common framework that anybody can access today.
32	Here, you can see 26,000 objects orbiting the earth, multiple opinions, and it gets updated in near real time.
33	But back to my problem of space traffic map: What if you only had information from the US government?
34	Well, in that case, that's what your space traffic map would look like.
35	But what do the Russians think?
36	That looks significantly different.
37	Who's right?
38	Who's wrong?
39	What should I believe?
40	What could I trust?
41	This is part of the issue.
42	In the absence of this framework to monitor space-actor behavior, to monitor activity in space — where these objects are located — to reconcile these inconsistencies and make this knowledge commonplace, we actually risk losing the ability to use space for humanity's benefit.
43	Thank you very much.
44	(Applause and cheers)
0	This syringe contains a radioactive form of glucose known as FDG.
1	The doctor will soon inject its contents into her patient’s arm, whom she’s testing for cancer using a PET scanner.
2	The FDG will quickly circulate through his body.
3	If he has a tumor, cancer cells within it will take up a significant portion of the FDG, which will act as a beacon for the scanner.
4	PET tracers such as FDG are among the most remarkable tools in medical diagnostics, and their life begins in a particle accelerator, just hours earlier.
5	The particle accelerator in question is called a cyclotron, and it’s often housed in a bunker within hospitals.
6	It uses electromagnetic fields to propel charged particles like protons faster and faster along a spiraling path.
7	When the protons reach their maximum speed, they shoot out onto a target that contains a few milliliters of a type of water with a heavy form of oxygen called oxygen-18.
8	When a proton slams into one of these heavier oxygen atoms, it kicks out another subatomic particle called a neutron.
9	This impact turns oxygen-18 into fluorine-18, a radioactive isotope that can be detected on a PET scan.
10	In a little under two hours, about half the fluorine will be gone due to radioactive decay, so the clock is ticking to get the scan done.
11	So how can fluorine-18 be used to detect diseases?
12	Radiochemists at the hospital can use a series of chemical reactions to attach the radioactive fluorine to different molecules, creating radiotracers.
13	The identity of the tracer depends on what doctors want to observe.
14	FDG is a common one because the rate at which cells consume glucose can signal the presence of cancer; the location of an infection; or the slowing brain function of dementia.
15	The FDG is now ready for the patient’s scan.
16	When a radiolabeled tracer enters the body, it travels through the circulatory system and gets taken up by its target— whether that's a protein in the brain, cancer cells, or otherwise.
17	Within a few minutes, a significant amount of the tracer has found its way to the target area and the rest has cleared from circulation.
18	Now the doctors can see their target using a PET, or positron emission tomography, scanner.
19	The radiation that the tracer emits is what makes this possible.
20	The isotopes used in PET decay by positron emission.
21	Positrons are essentially electrons with positive charge.
22	When emitted, a positron collides with an electron from another molecule in its surroundings.
23	This causes a tiny nuclear reaction in which the mass of the two particles is converted into two high-energy photons, similar to X-rays, that shoot out in opposite directions.
24	These photons will then impact an array of paired radiation detectors in the scanner walls.
25	The software in the scanner uses those detectors to estimate where inside the body the collision occurred and create a 3D map of the tracer’s distribution.
26	PET scans can detect the spread of cancer before it can be spotted with other types of imaging.
27	They’re also revolutionizing the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease by allowing doctors to see amyloid, the telltale protein buildup that otherwise couldn’t be confirmed without an autopsy.
28	Meanwhile, researchers are actively working to develop new tracers and expand the possibilities of what PET scans can be used for.
29	But with all this talk of radiation and nuclear reactions inside the body, are these scans safe?
30	Even though no amount of ionizing radiation is completely safe, the amount of radiation the body receives during a PET scan is actually quite low.
31	One scan is comparable to what you’re exposed to over two or three years from natural radioactive sources, like radon gas; or the amount a pilot would rack up from cosmic radiation after 20 to 30 transatlantic flights.
32	Most patients feel that those risks are acceptable for the chance to diagnose and treat their illnesses.
0	Now, people have a lot of misconceptions about science — about how it works and what it is.
1	A big one is that science is just a big old pile of facts.
2	But that's not true — that's not even the goal of science.
3	Science is a process.
4	It's a way of thinking.
5	Gathering facts is just a piece of it, but it's not the goal.
6	The ultimate goal of science is to understand objective reality the best way we know how, and that's based on evidence.
7	The problem here is that people are flawed.
8	We can be fooled — we're really good at fooling ourselves.
9	And so baked into this process is a way of minimizing our own bias.
10	So sort of boiled down more than is probably useful, here's how this works.
11	"If you want to do some science, what you want to do is you want to observe something ... say, ""The sky is blue."
12	"Hey, I wonder why?"""
13	You question it.
14	The next thing you do is you come up with an idea that may explain it: a hypothesis.
15	Well, you know what?
16	Oceans are blue.
17	Maybe the sky is reflecting the colors from the ocean.
18	Great, but now you have to test it so you predict what that might mean.
19	"Your prediction would be, ""Well, if the sky is reflecting the ocean color, it will be bluer on the coasts than it will be in the middle of the country."""
20	OK, that's fair enough, but you've got to test that prediction so you get on a plane, you leave Denver on a nice gray day, you fly to LA, you look up and the sky is gloriously blue.
21	Hooray, your thesis is proven.
22	But is it really?
23	No.
24	You've made one observation.
25	You need to think about your hypothesis, think about how to test it and do more than just one.
26	Maybe you could go to a different part of the country or a different part of the year and see what the weather's like then.
27	Another good idea is to talk to other people.
28	They have different ideas, different perspectives, and they can help you.
29	This is what we call peer review.
30	And in fact that will probably also save you a lot of money and a lot of time, flying coast-to-coast just to check the weather.
31	Now, what happens if your hypothesis does a decent job but not a perfect job?
32	Well, that's OK, because what you can do is you can modify it a little bit and then go through this whole process again — make predictions, test them — and as you do that over and over again, you will hone this idea.
33	And if it gets good enough, it may be accepted by the scientific community, at least provisionally, as a good explanation of what's going on, at least until a better idea or some contradictory evidence comes along.
34	Now, part of this process is admitting when you're wrong.
35	And that can be really, really hard.
36	Science has its strengths and weaknesses and they depend on this.
37	One of the strengths of science is that it's done by people, and it's proven itself to do a really good job.
38	We understand the universe pretty well because of science.
39	One of science's weaknesses is that it's done by people, and we bring a lot of baggage along with us when we investigate things.
40	We are egotistical, we are stubborn, we're superstitious, we're tribal, we're humans — these are all human traits and scientists are humans.
41	And so we have to be aware of that when we're studying science and when we're trying to develop our theses.
42	But part of this whole thing, part of this scientific process, part of the scientific method, is admitting when you're wrong.
43	I know, I've been there.
44	"Many years ago I was working on Hubble Space Telescope, and a scientist I worked with came to me with some data, and he said, ""I think there may be a picture of a planet orbiting another star in this data."""
45	We had not had any pictures taken of planets orbiting other stars yet, so if this were true, then this would be the first one and we would be the ones who found it.
46	That's a big deal.
47	I was very excited, so I just dug right into this data.
48	I spent a long time trying to figure out if this thing were a planet or not.
49	The problem is planets are faint and stars are bright, so trying to get the signal out of this data was like trying to hear a whisper in a heavy metal concert — it was really hard.
50	I tried everything I could, but after a month of working on this, I came to a realization ... couldn't do it.
51	I had to give up.
52	"And I had to tell this other scientist, ""The data's too messy."
53	"We can't say whether this is a planet or not."""
54	And that was hard.
55	Then later on we got follow-up observations with Hubble, and it showed that it wasn't a planet.
56	It was a background star or galaxy, something like that.
57	Well, not to get too technical, but that sucked.
58	(Laughter)
59	I was really unhappy about this.
60	But that's part of it.
61	"You have to say, ""Look, you know, we can't do this with the data we have."""
62	And then I had to face up to the fact that even the follow-up data showed we were wrong.
63	Emotionally I was pretty unhappy.
64	But if a scientist is doing their job correctly, being wrong is not so bad because that means there's still more stuff out there — more things to figure out.
65	Scientists don't love being wrong but we love puzzles, and the universe is the biggest puzzle of them all.
66	Now having said that, if you have a piece and it doesn't fit no matter how you move it, jamming it in harder isn't going to help.
67	There's going to be a time when you have to let go of your idea if you want to understand the bigger picture.
68	The price of doing science is admitting when you're wrong, but the payoff is the best there is: knowledge and understanding.
69	And I can give you a thousand examples of this in science, but there's one I really like.
70	It has to do with astronomy, and it was a question that had been plaguing astronomers literally for centuries.
71	When you look at the Sun, it seems special.
72	It is the brightest object in the sky, but having studied astronomy, physics, chemistry, thermodynamics for centuries, we learned something very important about it.
73	It's not that special.
74	It's a star just like millions of other stars.
75	But that raises an interesting question.
76	If the Sun is a star and the Sun has planets, do these other stars have planets?
77	"Well, like I said with my own failure in the ""planet"" I was looking for, finding them is super hard, but scientists tend to be pretty clever people and they used a lot of different techniques and started observing stars."
78	And over the decades they started finding some things that were pretty interesting, right on the thin, hairy edge of what they were able to detect.
79	But time and again, it was shown to be wrong.
80	That all changed in 1991.
81	A couple of astronomers — Alexander Lyne — Andrew Lyne, pardon me — and Matthew Bailes, had a huge announcement.
82	They had found a planet orbiting another star.
83	And not just any star, but a pulsar, and this is the remnant of a star that has previously exploded.
84	It's blasting out radiation.
85	This is the last place in the universe you would expect to find a planet, but they had very methodically looked at this pulsar, and they detected the gravitational tug of this planet as it orbited the pulsar.
86	It looked really good.
87	The first planet orbiting another star had been found ... except not so much.
88	(Laughter)
89	After they made the announcement, a bunch of other astronomers commented on it, and so they went back and looked at their data and realized they had made a very embarrassing mistake.
90	They had not accounted for some very subtle characteristics of the Earth's motion around the Sun, which affected how they measured this planet going around the pulsar.
91	And it turns out that when they did account for it correctly, poof — their planet disappeared.
92	It wasn't real.
93	So Andrew Lyne had a very formidable task.
94	He had to admit this.
95	So in 1992 at the American Astronomical Society meeting, which is one of the largest gatherings of astronomers on the planet, he stood up and announced that he had made a mistake and that the planet did not exist.
96	And what happened next — oh, I love this — what happened next was wonderful.
97	He got an ovation.
98	The astronomers weren't angry at him; they didn't want to chastise him.
99	They praised him for his honesty and his integrity.
100	I love that!
101	Scientists are people.
102	(Laughter)
103	And it gets better!
104	(Laughter)
105	Lyne steps off the podium.
106	"The next guy to come up is a man named Aleksander Wolszczan He takes the microphone and says, ""Yeah, so Lyne's team didn't find a pulsar planet, but my team found not just one but two planets orbiting a different pulsar."
107	"We knew about the problem that Lyne had, we checked for it, and yeah, ours are real."""
108	And it turns out he was right.
109	And in fact, a few months later, they found a third planet orbiting this pulsar and it was the first exoplanet system ever found — what we call alien worlds — exoplanets.
110	That to me is just wonderful.
111	At that point the floodgates were opened.
112	In 1995 a planet was found around a star more like the Sun, and then we found another and another.
113	This is an image of an actual planet orbiting an actual star.
114	We kept getting better at it.
115	We started finding them by the bucketload.
116	We started finding thousands of them.
117	We built observatories specifically designed to look for them.
118	And now we know of thousands of them.
119	We even know of planetary systems.
120	That is actual data, animated, showing four planets orbiting another star.
121	This is incredible.
122	Think about that.
123	For all of human history, you could count all the known planets in the universe on two hands — nine — eight?
124	Nine?
125	Eight — eight.
126	(Laughter)
127	Eh.
128	(Laughter)
129	But now we know they're everywhere.
130	Every star — for every star you see in the sky there could be three, five, ten planets.
131	The sky is filled with them.
132	We think that planets may outnumber stars in the galaxy.
133	This is a profound statement, and it was made because of science.
134	And it wasn't made just because of science and the observatories and the data; it was made because of the scientists who built the observatories, who took the data, who made the mistakes and admitted them and then let other scientists build on their mistakes so that they could do what they do and figure out where our place is in the universe.
135	That is how you find the truth.
136	Science is at its best when it dares to be human.
137	Thank you.
138	(Applause and cheers)
0	So, there's about seven and a half billion of us.
1	The World Health Organization tells us that 300 million of us are depressed, and about 800,000 people take their lives every year.
2	A tiny subset of them choose a profoundly nihilistic route, which is they die in the act of killing as many people as possible.
3	These are some famous recent examples.
4	And here's a less famous one.
5	It happened about nine weeks ago.
6	If you don't remember it, it's because there's a lot of this going on.
7	Wikipedia just last year counted 323 mass shootings in my home country, the United States.
8	Not all of those shooters were suicidal, not all of them were maximizing their death tolls, but many, many were.
9	An important question becomes: What limits do these people have?
10	Take the Vegas shooter.
11	He slaughtered 58 people.
12	Did he stop there because he'd had enough?
13	No, and we know this because he shot and injured another 422 people who he surely would have preferred to kill.
14	We have no reason to think he would have stopped at 4,200.
15	In fact, with somebody this nihilistic, he may well have gladly killed us all.
16	We don't know.
17	What we do know is this: when suicidal murderers really go all in, technology is the force multiplier.
18	Here's an example.
19	Several years back, there was a rash of 10 mass school attacks in China carried out with things like knives and hammers and cleavers, because guns are really hard to get there.
20	By macabre coincidence, this last attack occurred just hours before the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut.
21	But that one American attack killed roughly the same number of victims as the 10 Chinese attacks combined.
22	So we can fairly say, knife: terrible; gun: way worse.
23	And airplane: massively worse, as pilot Andreas Lubitz showed when he forced 149 people to join him in his suicide, smashing a plane into the French Alps.
24	And there are other examples of this.
25	And I'm afraid there are far more deadly weapons in our near future than airplanes, ones not made of metal.
26	So let's consider the apocalyptic dynamics that will ensue if suicidal mass murder hitches a ride on a rapidly advancing field that for the most part holds boundless promise for society.
27	Somewhere out there in the world, there's a tiny group of people who would attempt, however ineptly, to kill us all if they could just figure out how.
28	The Vegas shooter may or may not have been one of them, but with seven and a half billion of us, this is a nonzero population.
29	There's plenty of suicidal nihilists out there.
30	We've already seen that.
31	There's people with severe mood disorders that they can't even control.
32	There are people who have just suffered deranging traumas, etc.
33	etc.
34	As for the corollary group, its size was simply zero forever until the Cold War, when suddenly, the leaders of two global alliances attained the ability to blow up the world.
35	The number of people with actual doomsday buttons has stayed fairly stable since then.
36	But I'm afraid it's about to grow, and not just to three.
37	This is going off the charts.
38	I mean, it's going to look like a tech business plan.
39	(Laughter)
40	And the reason is, we're in the era of exponential technologies, which routinely take eternal impossibilities and make them the actual superpowers of one or two living geniuses and — this is the big part — then diffuse those powers to more or less everybody.
41	Now, here's a benign example.
42	If you wanted to play checkers with a computer in 1952, you literally had to be that guy, then commandeer one of the world's 19 copies of that computer, then used your Nobel-adjacent brain to teach it checkers.
43	That was the bar.
44	Today, you just need to know someone who knows someone who owns a telephone, because computing is an exponential technology.
45	"So is synthetic biology, which I'll now refer to as ""synbio."""
46	And in 2011, a couple of researchers did something every bit as ingenious and unprecedented as the checkers trick with H5N1 flu.
47	This is a strain that kills up to 60 percent of the people it infects, more than Ebola.
48	But it is so uncontagious that it's killed fewer than 50 people since 2015.
49	So these researchers edited H5N1's genome and made it every bit as deadly, but also wildly contagious.
50	The news arm of one of the world's top two scientific journals said if this thing got out, it would likely cause a pandemic with perhaps millions of deaths.
51	And Dr. Paul Keim said he could not think of an organism as scary as this, which is the last thing I personally want to hear from the Chairman of the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity.
52	And by the way, Dr. Keim also said this —
53	"[""I don't think anthrax is scary at all compared to this.""]"
54	And he's also one of these.
55	[Anthrax expert] (Laughter)
56	Now, the good news about the 2011 biohack is that the people who did it didn't mean us any harm.
57	They're virologists.
58	They believed they were advancing science.
59	The bad news is that technology does not freeze in place, and over the next few decades, their feat will become trivially easy.
60	In fact, it's already way easier, because as we learned yesterday morning, just two years after they did their work, the CRISPR system was harnessed for genome editing.
61	This was a radical breakthrough that makes gene editing massively easier — so easy that CRISPR is now taught in high schools.
62	And this stuff is moving quicker than computing.
63	That slow, stodgy white line up there?
64	That's Moore's law.
65	That shows us how quickly computing is getting cheaper.
66	That steep, crazy-fun green line, that shows us how quickly genetic sequencing is getting cheaper.
67	Now, gene editing and synthesis and sequencing, they're different disciplines, but they're tightly related.
68	And they're all moving in these headlong rates.
69	And the keys to the kingdom are these tiny, tiny data files.
70	That is an excerpt of H5N1's genome.
71	The whole thing can fit on just a few pages.
72	And yeah, don't worry, you can Google this as soon as you get home.
73	It's all over the internet, right?
74	And the part that made it contagious could well fit on a single Post-it note.
75	And once a genius makes a data file, any idiot can copy it, distribute it worldwide or print it.
76	And I don't just mean print it on this, but soon enough, on this.
77	So let's imagine a scenario.
78	Let's say it's 2026, to pick an arbitrary year, and a brilliant virologist, hoping to advance science and better understand pandemics, designs a new bug.
79	It's as contagious as chicken pox, it's as deadly as Ebola, and it incubates for months and months before causing an outbreak, so the whole world can be infected before the first sign of trouble.
80	Then, her university gets hacked.
81	And of course, this is not science fiction.
82	In fact, just one recent US indictment documents the hacking of over 300 universities.
83	So that file with the bug's genome on it spreads to the internet's dark corners.
84	And once a file is out there, it never comes back — just ask anybody who runs a movie studio or a music label.
85	So now maybe in 2026, it would take a true genius like our virologist to make the actual living critter, but 15 years later, it may just take a DNA printer you can find at any high school.
86	And if not?
87	Give it a couple of decades.
88	So, a quick aside: Remember this slide here?
89	Turn your attention to these two words.
90	If somebody tries this and is only 0.1 percent effective, eight million people die.
91	That's 2,500 9/11s.
92	Civilization would survive, but it would be permanently disfigured.
93	So this means we need to be concerned about anybody who has the faintest shot on goal, not just geniuses.
94	So today, there's a tiny handful of geniuses who probably could make a doomsday bug that's .1-percent effective and maybe even a little bit more.
95	They tend to be stable and successful and so not part of this group.
96	So I guess I'm sorta kinda barely OK-ish with that.
97	But what about after technology improves and diffuses and thousands of life science grad students are enabled?
98	Are every single one of them going to be perfectly stable?
99	Or how about a few years after that, where every stress-ridden premed is fully enabled?
100	At some point in that time frame, these circles are going to intersect, because we're now starting to talk about hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world.
101	And they recently included that guy who dressed up like the Joker and shot 12 people to death at a Batman premiere.
102	That was a neuroscience PhD student with an NIH grant.
103	OK, plot twist: I think we can actually survive this one if we start focusing on it now.
104	And I say this, having spent countless hours interviewing global leaders in synbio and also researching their work for science podcasts I create.
105	I have come to fear their work, in case I haven't gotten that out there yet —
106	(Laughter)
107	but more than that, to revere its potential.
108	This stuff will cure cancer, heal our environment and stop our cruel treatment of other creatures.
109	So how do we get all this without, you know, annihilating ourselves?
110	First thing: like it or not, synbio is here, so let's embrace the technology.
111	If we do a tech ban, that would only hand the wheel to bad actors.
112	Unlike nuclear programs, biology can be practiced invisibly.
113	Massive Soviet cheating on bioweapons treaties made that very clear, as does every illegal drug lab in the world.
114	Secondly, enlist the experts.
115	Let's sign them up and make more of them.
116	For every million and one bioengineers we have, at least a million of them are going to be on our side.
117	I mean, Al Capone would be on our side in this one.
118	The bar to being a good guy is just so low.
119	And massive numerical advantages do matter, even when a single bad guy can inflict grievous harm, because among many other things, they allow us to exploit the hell out of this: we have years and hopefully decades to prepare and prevent.
120	The first person to try something awful — and there will be somebody — may not even be born yet.
121	Next, this needs to be an effort that spans society, and all of you need to be a part of it, because we cannot ask a tiny group of experts to be responsible for both containing and exploiting synthetic biology, because we already tried that with the financial system, and our stewards became massively corrupted as they figured out how they could cut corners, inflict massive, massive risks on the rest of us and privatize the gains, becoming repulsively wealthy while they stuck us with the $22 trillion bill.
122	And more recently —
123	(Applause)
124	Are you the ones who have gotten the thank-you letters?
125	I'm still waiting for mine.
126	I just figured they were too busy to be grateful.
127	And much more recently, online privacy started looming as a huge issue, and we basically outsourced it.
128	And once again: privatized gains, socialized losses.
129	Is anybody else sick of this pattern?
130	(Applause)
131	So we need a more inclusive way to safeguard our prosperity, our privacy and soon, our lives.
132	So how do we do all of this?
133	Well, when bodies fight pathogens, they use ingenious immune systems, which are very complex and multilayered.
134	Why don't we build one of these for the whole damn ecosystem?
135	There's a year of TED Talks that could be given on this first critical layer.
136	So these are just a couple of many great ideas that are out there.
137	Some R and D muscle could take the very primitive pathogen sensors that we currently have and put them on a very steep price performance curve that would quickly become ingenious and networked and gradually as widespread as smoke detectors and even smartphones.
138	On a very related note: vaccines have all kinds of problems when it comes to manufacturing and distribution, and once they're made, they can't adapt to new threats or mutations.
139	We need an agile biomanufacturing base extending into every single pharmacy and maybe even our homes.
140	Printer technology for vaccines and medicines is within reach if we prioritize it.
141	Next, mental health.
142	Many people who commit suicidal mass murder suffer from crippling, treatment-resistant depression or PTSD.
143	We need noble researchers like Rick Doblin working on this, but we also need the selfish jerks who are way more numerous to appreciate the fact that acute suffering will soon endanger all of us, not just those afflicted.
144	Those jerks will then join us and Al Capone in fighting this condition.
145	Third, each and every one of us can be and should be a white blood cell in this immune system.
146	Suicidal mass murderers can be despicable, yes, but they're also terribly broken and sad people, and those of us who aren't need to do what we can to make sure nobody goes unloved.
147	(Applause)
148	Next, we need to make fighting these dangers core to the discipline of synthetic biology.
149	There are companies out there that at least claim they let their engineers spend 20 percent of their time doing whatever they want.
150	What if those who hire bioengineers and become them give 20 percent of their time to building defenses for the common good?
151	Not a bad idea, right?
152	(Applause)
153	Then, finally: this won't be any fun.
154	But we need to let our minds go to some very, very dark places, and thank you for letting me take you there this evening.
155	"We survived the Cold War because every one of us understood and respected the danger, in part, because we had spent decades telling ourselves terrifying ghost stories with names like ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""War Games."""
156	This is no time to remain calm.
157	This is one of those rare times when it's incredibly productive to freak the hell out —
158	(Laughter)
159	to come up with some ghost stories and use our fear as fuel to fight this danger.
160	Because, all these terrible scenarios I've painted — they are not destiny.
161	They're optional.
162	The danger is still kind of distant.
163	And that means it will only befall us if we allow it to.
164	Let's not.
165	Thank you very much for listening.
166	(Applause)
0	So for the past 12 years, I've been obsessed with this idea that climate change is an information issue that computers will help us fight.
1	I went from data science to climate policy research, from tech to public service, in pursuit of better data to avoid the wasted energy, resources, opportunities that lead to runaway carbon emissions.
2	Until one day, running in the streets with a friend, it hit me: the same cars, factories, power plants whose emissions are wrecking our climate over time also release harmful, local pollutants that threaten our health right here and right now.
3	All this time I'd focused on the long-term environmental risk when I should have been up in arms about the immediate health impact of pollutants in the air.
4	Air pollution is a burning public health crisis.
5	It kills seven million people every year, it costs five trillion dollars to the world economy and, worst, it robs us of our most precious gift, the years in our lives: six months of life expectancy in my hometown of Paris and up to three, four, five years in parts of India and China.
6	And in the US, more people die from car exhaust than from car accidents.
7	So how do we protect ourselves from pollution?
8	The reason it's difficult is an information gap.
9	We simply lack the data to understand our exposure.
10	And that's because the way we monitor air quality today is designed not to help people breathe but to help governments govern.
11	Most major cities operate networks of air-quality monitoring stations like this one in London, to decide when to cut traffic or when to shut down factories.
12	And these machines are like the computers from the '60s that filled entire rooms.
13	They're incredibly precise but incredibly large, heavy, costly — so much that you can only deploy just a few of them, and they cannot move.
14	So to governments, air pollution looks like this.
15	But for the rest of us, air quality looks like this.
16	It changes all the time: hour by hour, street by street, up to eight times within a single city block.
17	And even more from indoor to outdoor.
18	So unless you happen to be walking right next to one of those stations, they just cannot tell you what you breathe.
19	So what would environmental protection look like if it was designed for the age of the smartphone?
20	So for the past three years, my team and I have been building a technology that helps you know what you breathe and fits in your hand.
21	Flow is a personal air-quality tracker that you can wear with you on a backpack, a bike, a stroller.
22	It's packed with miniature sensors that monitor the most important pollutants in the air around you, like nitrogen oxides, the exhaust gas from cars, or particulate matter that gets into your bloodstream and creates strokes and heart issues.
23	Or volatile organic compounds, the thousands of chemicals in everyday products that we end up breathing.
24	And that makes this data actionable and helps you understand what you're breathing by telling you where and when you've been exposed to poor air quality, and that way you can make informed decisions to take action against pollution.
25	You can change the products you use at home, you can find the best route to cycle to work, you can run when pollution is not peaking and you can find the best park to bring your children out.
26	Over time you build better habits to decrease your exposure to pollution, and by tracking air quality around them, cyclists, commuters, parents will also contribute to mapping air quality in their city.
27	So we're building more than a device, but a community.
28	And last summer, we sent early prototypes of our technology to 100 volunteers in London, and together they mapped air quality across 1,000 miles of sidewalk and 20 percent of all of central London.
29	So our goal now is to scale this work around the world, to crowdsource data so we can map air quality on every street, to build an unprecedented database so scientists can research pollution, and to empower citizens, civic leaders, policy makers to support clean-air policies for change.
30	Because this can and must change.
31	Remember cigarettes in bars?
32	It took decades of lung cancer research and second-hand smoking studies, but eventually, we reached a tipping point and we passed smoking-ban laws.
33	We must reach the same tipping point for air quality and I believe we will.
34	In the past couple years alone, governments have fined carmakers record amounts for cheating on emission standards.
35	Cities have passed congestion charges or built bike lanes — like Paris that turned this highway, right next to my home, in the middle of the city, into a waterfront park.
36	And now mayors around the world are thinking of banning diesel outright by 2025, 2030, 2035.
37	But how much faster could we go, how many lives could we save?
38	Technology alone will not solve climate change, nor will it make air pollution disappear overnight.
39	But it can make the quality of our air much more transparent, and if we can empower people to take action to improve their own health, then together we can act to bring an end to our pollution.
40	Thank you very much.

0	This is Henry, a cute boy, and when Henry was three, his mom found him having some febrile seizures.
1	"Febrile seizures are seizures that occur when you also have a fever, and the doctor said, ""Don't worry too much."
2	"Kids usually outgrow these."""
3	When he was four, he had a convulsive seizure, the kind that you lose consciousness and shake — a generalized tonic-clonic seizure — and while the diagnosis of epilepsy was in the mail, Henry's mom went to get him out of bed one morning, and as she went in his room, she found his cold, lifeless body.
4	Henry died of SUDEP, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.
5	I'm curious how many of you have heard of SUDEP.
6	This is a very well-educated audience, and I see only a few hands.
7	SUDEP is when an otherwise healthy person with epilepsy dies and they can't attribute it to anything they can find in an autopsy.
8	There is a SUDEP every seven to nine minutes.
9	That's on average two per TED Talk.
10	Now, a normal brain has electrical activity.
11	You can see some of the electrical waves coming out of this picture of a brain here.
12	And these should look like typical electrical activity that an EEG could read on the surface.
13	When you have a seizure, it's a bit of unusual electrical activity, and it can be focal.
14	It can take place in just a small part of your brain.
15	When that happens, you might have a strange sensation.
16	Several could be happening here in the audience right now, and the person next to you might not even know.
17	However, if you have a seizure where that little brush fire spreads like a forest fire over the brain, then it generalizes, and that generalized seizure takes your consciousness away and causes you to convulse.
18	There are more SUDEPs in the United States every year than sudden infant death syndrome.
19	Now, how many of you have heard of sudden infant death syndrome?
20	Right?
21	Pretty much every hand goes up.
22	So what's going on here?
23	Why is this so much more common and yet people haven't heard of it?
24	And what can you do to prevent it?
25	Well, there are two things, scientifically shown, that prevent or reduce the risk of SUDEP.
26	"The first is: ""Follow your doctor's instructions, take your medications."""
27	Two-thirds of people who have epilepsy get it under control with their medications.
28	The second thing that reduces the risk of SUDEP is companionship.
29	It's having somebody there at the time that you have a seizure.
30	Now, SUDEP, even though most of you have never heard of it, is actually the number two cause of years of potential life lost of all neurological disorders.
31	The vertical axis is the number of deaths times the remaining life span, so higher is much worse impact.
32	SUDEP, however, unlike these others, is something that people right here could do something to push that down.
33	Now, what is Roz Picard, an AI researcher, doing here telling you about SUDEP, right?
34	I'm not a neurologist.
35	When I was working at the Media Lab on measurement of emotion, trying to make our machines more intelligent about our emotions, we started doing a lot of work measuring stress.
36	We built lots of sensors that measured it in lots of different ways.
37	But one of them in particular grew out of some of this very old work with measuring sweaty palms with an electrical signal.
38	This is a signal of skin conductance that's known to go up when you get nervous, but it turns out it also goes up with a lot of other interesting conditions.
39	But measuring it with wires on your hand is really inconvenient.
40	So we invented a bunch of other ways of doing this at the MIT Media Lab.
41	And with these wearables, we started to collect the first-ever clinical quality data 24-7.
42	Here's a picture of what that looked like the first time an MIT student collected skin conductance on the wrist 24-7.
43	Let's zoom in a little bit here.
44	What you see is 24 hours from left to right, and here is two days of data.
45	And first, what surprised us was sleep was the biggest peak of the day.
46	Now, that sounds broken, right?
47	You're calm when you're asleep, so what's going on here?
48	Well, it turns out that our physiology during sleep is very different than our physiology during wake, and while there's still a bit of a mystery why these peaks are usually the biggest of the day during sleep, we now believe they're related to memory consolidation and memory formation during sleep.
49	We also saw things that were exactly what we expected.
50	When an MIT student is working hard in the lab or on homeworks, there is not only emotional stress, but there's cognitive load, and it turns out that cognitive load, cognitive effort, mental engagement, excitement about learning something — those things also make the signal go up.
51	Unfortunately, to the embarrassment of we MIT professors,
52	(Laughter)
53	the low point every day is classroom activity.
54	Now, I am just showing you one person's data here, but this, unfortunately, is true in general.
55	"This sweatband has inside it a homebuilt skin-conductance sensor, and one day, one of our undergrads knocked on my door right at the end of the December semester, and he said, ""Professor Picard, can I please borrow one of your wristband sensors?"
56	"My little brother has autism, he can't talk, and I want to see what's stressing him out."""
57	"And I said, ""Sure, in fact, don't just take one, take two,"" because they broke easily back then."
58	So he took them home, he put them on his little brother.
59	"Now, I was back in MIT, looking at the data on my laptop, and the first day, I thought, ""Hmm, that's odd, he put them on both wrists instead of waiting for one to break."
60	"OK, fine, don't follow my instructions."""
61	I'm glad he didn't.
62	Second day — chill.
63	Looked like classroom activity.
64	(Laughter)
65	A few more days ahead.
66	"The next day, one wrist signal was flat and the other had the biggest peak I've ever seen, and I thought, ""What's going on?"
67	We've stressed people out at MIT every way imaginable.
68	"I've never seen a peak this big."""
69	And it was only on one side.
70	How can you be stressed on one side of your body and not the other?
71	So I thought one or both sensors must be broken.
72	Now, I'm an electroengineer by training, so I started a whole bunch of stuff to try to debug this, and long story short, I could not reproduce this.
73	So I resorted to old-fashioned debugging.
74	I called the student at home on vacation.
75	"""Hi, how's your little brother?"
76	How's your Christmas?
77	"Hey, do you have any idea what happened to him?"""
78	And I gave this particular date and time, and the data.
79	"And he said, ""I don't know, I'll check the diary."""
80	Diary?
81	An MIT student keeps a diary?
82	So I waited and he came back.
83	"He had the exact date and time, and he says, ""That was right before he had a grand mal seizure."""
84	Now, at the time, I didn't know anything about epilepsy, and did a bunch of research, realized that another student's dad is chief of neurosurgery at Children's Hospital Boston, screwed up my courage and called Dr. Joe Madsen.
85	"""Hi, Dr. Madsen, my name's Rosalind Picard."
86	"Is it possible somebody could have a huge sympathetic nervous system surge"" — that's what drives the skin conductance — ""20 minutes before a seizure?"""
87	"And he says, ""Probably not."""
88	"He says, ""It's interesting."
89	"We've had people whose hair stands on end on one arm 20 minutes before a seizure."""
90	"And I'm like, ""On one arm?"""
91	I didn't want to tell him that, initially, because I thought this was too ridiculous.
92	He explained how this could happen in the brain, and he got interested.
93	I showed him the data.
94	We made a whole bunch more devices, got them safety certified.
95	90 families were being enrolled in a study, all with children who were going to be monitored 24-7 with gold-standard EEG on their scalp for reading the brain activity, video to watch the behavior, electrocardiogram — ECG — and now EDA, electrodermal activity, to see if there was something in this periphery that we could easily pick up, related to a seizure.
96	We found, in 100 percent of the first batch of grand mal seizures, this whopper of responses in the skin conductance.
97	The blue in the middle, the boy's sleep, is usually the biggest peak of the day.
98	These three seizures you see here are popping out of the forest like redwood trees.
99	Furthermore, when you couple the skin conductance at the top with the movement from the wrist and you get lots of data and train machine learning and AI on it, you can build an automated AI that detects these patterns much better than just a shake detector can do.
100	So we realized that we needed to get this out, and with the PhD work of Ming-Zher Poh and later great improvements by Empatica, this has made progress and the seizure detection is much more accurate.
101	But we also learned some other things about SUDEP during this.
102	One thing we learned is that SUDEP, while it's rare after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, that's when it's most likely to happen — after that type.
103	And when it happens, it doesn't happen during the seizure, and it doesn't usually happen immediately afterwards, but immediately afterwards, when the person just seems very still and quiet, they may go into another phase, where the breathing stops, and then after the breathing stops, later the heart stops.
104	So there's some time to get somebody there.
105	We also learned that there is a region deep in the brain called the amygdala, which we had been studying in our emotion research a lot.
106	We have two amygdalas, and if you stimulate the right one, you get a big right skin conductance response.
107	Now, you have to sign up right now for a craniotomy to get this done, not exactly something we're going to volunteer to do, but it causes a big right skin conductance response.
108	Stimulate the left one, big left skin conductance response on the palm.
109	And furthermore, when somebody stimulates your amygdala while you're sitting there and you might just be working, you don't show any signs of distress, but you stop breathing, and you don't start again until somebody stimulates you.
110	"""Hey, Roz, are you there?"""
111	And you open your mouth to talk.
112	As you take that breath to speak, you start breathing again.
113	So we had started with work on stress, which had enabled us to build lots of sensors that were gathering high quality enough data that we could leave the lab and start to get this in the wild; accidentally found a whopper of a response with the seizure, neurological activation that can cause a much bigger response than traditional stressors; lots of partnership with hospitals and an epilepsy monitoring unit, especially Children's Hospital Boston and the Brigham; and machine learning and AI on top of this to take and collect lots more data in service of trying to understand these events and if we could prevent SUDEP.
114	This is now commercialized by Empatica, a start-up that I had the privilege to cofound, and the team there has done an amazing job improving the technology to make a very beautiful sensor that not only tells time and does steps and sleep and all that good stuff, but this is running real-time AI and machine learning to detect generalized tonic-clonic seizures and send an alert for help if I were to have a seizure and lose consciousness.
115	This just got FDA-approved as the first smartwatch to get approved in neurology.
116	(Applause)
117	Now, the next slide is what made my skin conductance go up.
118	One morning, I'm checking my email and I see a story from a mom who said she was in the shower, and her phone was on the counter by the shower, and it said her daughter might need her help.
119	So she interrupts her shower and goes running to her daughter's bedroom, and she finds her daughter facedown in bed, blue and not breathing.
120	She flips her over — human stimulation — and her daughter takes a breath, and another breath, and her daughter turns pink and is fine.
121	I think I turned white reading this email.
122	"My first response is, ""Oh no, it's not perfect."
123	The Bluetooth could break, the battery could die.
124	All these things could go wrong.
125	"Don't rely on this."""
126	"And she said, ""It's OK."
127	I know no technology is perfect.
128	None of us can always be there all the time.
129	"But this, this device plus AI enabled me to get there in time to save my daughter's life."""
130	Now, I've been mentioning children, but SUDEP peaks, actually, among people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, and the next line I'm going to put up is probably going to make some people uncomfortable, but it's less uncomfortable than we'll all be if this list is extended to somebody you know.
131	Could this happen to somebody you know?
132	And the reason I bring up this uncomfortable question is because one in 26 of you will have epilepsy at some point, and from what I've been learning, people with epilepsy often don't tell their friends and their neighbors that they have it.
133	So if you're willing to let them use an AI or whatever to summon you in a moment of possible need, if you would let them know that, you could make a difference in their life.
134	Why do all this hard work to build AIs?
135	A couple of reasons here: one is Natasha, the girl who lived, and her family wanted me to tell you her name.
136	Another is her family and the wonderful people out there who want to be there to support people who have conditions that they've felt uncomfortable in the past mentioning to others.
137	And the other reason is all of you, because we have the opportunity to shape the future of AI.
138	We can actually change it, because we are the ones building it.
139	So let's build AI that makes everybody's lives better.
140	Thank you.
141	(Applause)
0	Bryn Freedman: You're a guy whose company funds these AI programs and invests.
1	So why should we trust you to not have a bias and tell us something really useful for the rest of us about the future of work?
2	Roy Bahat: Yes, I am.
3	"And when you wake up in the morning and you read the newspaper and it says, ""The robots are coming, they may take all our jobs,"" as a start-up investor focused on the future of work, our fund was the first one to say artificial intelligence should be a focus for us."
4	"So I woke up one morning and read that and said, ""Oh, my gosh, they're talking about me."
5	"That's me who's doing that."""
6	And then I thought: wait a minute.
7	If things continue, then maybe not only will the start-ups in which we invest struggle because there won't be people to have jobs to pay for the things that they make and buy them, but our economy and society might struggle, too.
8	"And look, I should be the guy who sits here and tells you, ""Everything is going to be fine."
9	It's all going to work out great.
10	"Hey, when they introduced the ATM machine, years later, there's more tellers in banks."""
11	It's true.
12	"And yet, when I looked at it, I thought, ""This is going to accelerate."
13	"And if it does accelerate, there's a chance the center doesn't hold."""
14	But I figured somebody must know the answer to this; there are so many ideas out there.
15	And I read all the books, and I went to the conferences, and at one point, we counted more than 100 efforts to study the future of work.
16	"And it was a frustrating experience, because I'd hear the same back-and-forth over and over again: ""The robots are coming!"""
17	"And then somebody else would say, ""Oh, don't worry about that, they've always said that and it turns out OK."" Then somebody else would say, ""Well, it's really about the meaning of your job, anyway."""
18	And then everybody would shrug and go off and have a drink.
19	And it felt like there was this Kabuki theater of this discussion, where nobody was talking to each other.
20	And many of the people that I knew and worked with in the technology world were not speaking to policy makers; the policy makers were not speaking to them.
21	And so we partnered with a nonpartisan think tank NGO called New America to study this issue.
22	And we brought together a group of people, including an AI czar at a technology company and a video game designer and a heartland conservative and a Wall Street investor and a socialist magazine editor — literally, all in the same room; it was occasionally awkward — to try to figure out what is it that will happen here.
23	The question we asked was simple.
24	It was: What is the effect of technology on work going to be?
25	And we looked out 10 to 20 years, because we wanted to look out far enough that there could be real change, but soon enough that we weren't talking about teleportation or anything like that.
26	And we recognized — and I think every year we're reminded of this in the world — that predicting what's going to happen is hard.
27	So instead of predicting, there are other things you can do.
28	You can try to imagine alternate possible futures, which is what we did.
29	We did a scenario-planning exercise, and we imagined cases where no job is safe.
30	We imagined cases where every job is safe.
31	And we imagined every distinct possibility we could.
32	And the result, which really surprised us, was when you think through those futures and you think what should we do, the answers about what we should do actually turn out to be the same, no matter what happens.
33	And the irony of looking out 10 to 20 years into the future is, you realize that the things we want to act on are actually already happening right now.
34	The automation is right now, the future is right now.
35	BF: So what does that mean, and what does that tell us?
36	If the future is now, what is it that we should be doing, and what should we be thinking about?
37	RB: We have to understand the problem first.
38	And so the data are that as the economy becomes more productive and individual workers become more productive, their wages haven't risen.
39	If you look at the proportion of prime working-age men, in the United States at least, who work now versus in 1960, we have three times as many men not working.
40	And then you hear the stories.
41	"I sat down with a group of Walmart workers and said, ""What do you think about this cashier, this futuristic self-checkout thing?"""
42	"They said, ""That's nice, but have you heard about the cash recycler?"
43	"That's a machine that's being installed right now, and is eliminating two jobs at every Walmart right now."""
44	"And so we just thought, ""Geez."
45	"We don't understand the problem."""
46	And so we looked at the voices that were the ones that were excluded, which is all of the people affected by this change.
47	"And we decided to listen to them, sort of ""automation and its discontents."""
48	And I've spent the last couple of years doing that.
49	I've been to Flint, Michigan, and Youngstown, Ohio, talking about entrepreneurs, trying to make it work in a very different environment from New York or San Francisco or London or Tokyo.
50	I've been to prisons twice to talk to inmates about their jobs after they leave.
51	I've sat down with truck drivers to ask them about the self-driving truck, with people who, in addition to their full-time job, care for an aging relative.
52	And when you talk to people, there were two themes that came out loud and clear.
53	The first one was that people are less looking for more money or get out of the fear of the robot taking their job, and they just want something stable.
54	They want something predictable.
55	So if you survey people and ask them what they want out of work, for everybody who makes less than 150,000 dollars a year, they'll take a more stable and secure income, on average, over earning more money.
56	"And if you think about the fact that not only for all of the people across the earth who don't earn a living, but for those who do, the vast majority earn a different amount from month to month and have an instability, all of a sudden you realize, ""Wait a minute."
57	"We have a real problem on our hands."""
58	And the second thing they say, which took us a longer time to understand, is they say they want dignity.
59	And that concept of self-worth through work emerged again and again and again in our conversations.
60	BF: So, I certainly appreciate this answer.
61	But you can't eat dignity, you can't clothe your children with self-esteem.
62	So, what is that, how do you reconcile — what does dignity mean, and what is the relationship between dignity and stability?
63	RB: You can't eat dignity.
64	You need stability first.
65	And the good news is, many of the conversations that are happening right now are about how we solve that.
66	You know, I'm a proponent of studying guaranteed income, as one example, conversations about how health care gets provided and other benefits.
67	Those conversations are happening, and we're at a time where we must figure that out.
68	It is the crisis of our era.
69	And my point of view after talking to people is that we may do that, and it still might not be enough.
70	Because what we need to do from the beginning is understand what is it about work that gives people dignity, so they can live the lives that they want to live.
71	"And so that concept of dignity is ... it's difficult to get your hands around, because when many people hear it — especially, to be honest, rich people — they hear ""meaning."""
72	"They hear ""My work is important to me."""
73	"And again, if you survey people and you ask them, ""How important is it to you that your work be important to you?"""
74	only people who make 150,000 dollars a year or more say that it is important to them that their work be important.
75	BF: Meaning, meaningful?
76	"RB: Just defined as, ""Is your work important to you?"""
77	Whatever somebody took that to mean.
78	And yet, of course dignity is essential.
79	"We talked to truck drivers who said, ""I saw my cousin drive, and I got on the open road and it was amazing."
80	"And I started making more money than people who went to college."""
81	"Then they'd get to the end of their thought and say something like, ""People need their fruits and vegetables in the morning, and I'm the guy who gets it to them."""
82	We talked to somebody who, in addition to his job, was caring for his aunt.
83	He was making plenty of money.
84	"At one point we just asked, ""What is it about caring for your aunt?"
85	"Can't you just pay somebody to do it?"""
86	"He said, ""My aunt doesn't want somebody we pay for."
87	"My aunt wants me."""
88	So there was this concept there of being needed.
89	"If you study the word ""dignity,"" it's fascinating."
90	It's one of the oldest words in the English language, from antiquity.
91	And it has two meanings: one is self-worth, and the other is that something is suitable, it's fitting, meaning that you're part of something greater than yourself, and it connects to some broader whole.
92	In other words, that you're needed.
93	BF: So how do you answer this question, this concept that we don't pay teachers, and we don't pay eldercare workers, and we don't pay people who really care for people and are needed, enough?
94	RB: Well, the good news is, people are finally asking the question.
95	"So as AI investors, we often get phone calls from foundations or CEOs and boardrooms saying, ""What do we do about this?"""
96	"And they used to be asking, ""What do we do about introducing automation?"""
97	"And now they're asking, ""What do we do about self-worth?"""
98	And they know that the employees who work for them who have a spouse who cares for somebody, that dignity is essential to their ability to just do their job.
99	I think there's two kinds of answers: there's the money side of just making your life work.
100	That's stability.
101	You need to eat.
102	And then you think about our culture more broadly, and you ask: Who do we make into heroes?
103	And, you know, what I want is to see the magazine cover that is the person who is the heroic caregiver.
104	Or the Netflix series that dramatizes the person who makes all of our other lives work so we can do the things we do.
105	Let's make heroes out of those people.
106	That's the Netflix show that I would binge.
107	And we've had chroniclers of this before — Studs Terkel, the oral history of the working experience in the United States.
108	And what we need is the experience of needing one another and being connected to each other.
109	Maybe that's the answer for how we all fit as a society.
110	"And the thought exercise, to me, is: if you were to go back 100 years and have people — my grandparents, great-grandparents, a tailor, worked in a mine — they look at what all of us do for a living and say, ""That's not work."""
111	We sit there and type and talk, and there's no danger of getting hurt.
112	And my guess is that if you were to imagine 100 years from now, we'll still be doing things for each other.
113	We'll still need one another.
114	And we just will think of it as work.
115	The entire thing I'm trying to say is that dignity should not just be about having a job.
116	Because if you say you need a job to have dignity, which many people say, the second you say that, you say to all the parents and all the teachers and all the caregivers that all of a sudden, because they're not being paid for what they're doing, it somehow lacks this essential human quality.
117	To me, that's the great puzzle of our time: Can we figure out how to provide that stability throughout life, and then can we figure out how to create an inclusive, not just racially, gender, but multigenerationally inclusive — I mean, every different human experience included — in this way of understanding how we can be needed by one another.
118	BF: Thank you.
119	RB: Thank you.
120	BF: Thank you very much for your participation.

0	The world today has many problems.
1	And they're all very complicated and interconnected and difficult.
2	But there is something we can do.
3	I believe that girls' education is the closest thing we have to a silver bullet to help solve some of the world's most difficult problems.
4	But you don't have to take my word for it.
5	The World Bank says that girls' education is one of the best investments that a country can make.
6	It helps to positively impact nine of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
7	Everything from health, nutrition, employment — all of these are positively impacted when girls are educated.
8	Additionally, climate scientists have recently rated girls' education at number six out of 80 actions to reverse global warming.
9	At number six, it's rated higher than solar panels and electric cars.
10	And that's because when girls are educated, they have smaller families, and the resulting reduction in population reduces carbon emissions significantly.
11	But more than that, you know, it's a problem we have to solve once.
12	Because an educated mother is more than twice as likely to educate her children.
13	Which means that by doing it once, we can close the gender and literacy gap forever.
14	I work in India, which has made incredible progress in bringing elementary education for all.
15	However, we still have four million out-of-school girls, one of the highest in the world.
16	And girls are out of school because of, obviously poverty, social, cultural factors.
17	But there's also this underlying factor of mindset.
18	I have met a girl whose name was Naraaz Nath.
19	Naaraaz means angry.
20	"And when I asked her, ""Why is your name 'angry'?"""
21	"she said, ""Because everybody was so angry when a girl was born."""
22	Another girl called Antim Bala, which means the last girl.
23	Because everybody hoped that would be the last girl to be born.
24	A girl called Aachuki.
25	It means somebody who has arrived.
26	Not wanted, but arrived.
27	And it is this mindset that keeps girls from school or completing their education.
28	It's this belief that a goat is an asset and a girl is a liability.
29	My organization Educate Girls works to change this.
30	And we work in some of the most difficult, rural, remote and tribal villages.
31	And how do we do it?
32	We first and foremost find young, passionate, educated youth from the same villages.
33	Both men and women.
34	And we call them Team Balika, balika just means the girl child, so this is a team that we are creating for the girl child.
35	And so once we recruit our community volunteers, we train them, we mentor them, we hand-hold them.
36	That's when our work starts.
37	And the first piece we do is about identifying every single girl who's not going to school.
38	But the way we do it is a little different and high-tech, at least in my view.
39	Each of our frontline staff have a smartphone.
40	It has its own Educate Girls app.
41	And this app has everything that our team needs.
42	It has digital maps of where they're going to be conducting the survey, it has the survey in it, all the questions, little guides on how best to conduct the survey, so that the data that comes to us is in real time and is of good quality.
43	So armed with this, our teams and our volunteers go door-to-door to every single household to find every single girl who may either we never enrolled or dropped out of school.
44	And because we have this data and technology piece, very quickly we can figure out who the girls are and where they are.
45	Because each of our villages are geotagged, and we can actually build that information out very, very quickly.
46	And so once we know where the girls are, we actually start the process of bringing them back into school.
47	And that actually is just our community mobilization process, it starts with village meetings, neighborhood meetings, and as you see, individual counseling of parents and families, to be able to bring the girls back into school.
48	And this can take anything from a few weeks to a few months.
49	And once we bring the girls into the school system, we also work with the schools to make sure that schools have all the basic infrastructure so that the girls will be able to stay.
50	And this would include a separate toilet for girls, drinking water, things that will help them to be retained.
51	But all of this would be useless if our children weren't learning.
52	So we actually run a learning program.
53	And this is a supplementary learning program, and it's very, very important, because most of our children are first-generation learners.
54	That means there's nobody at home to help them with homework, there's nobody who can support their education.
55	Their parents can't read and write.
56	So it's really, really key that we do the support of the learning in the classrooms.
57	So this is essentially our model, in terms of finding, bringing the girls in, making sure that they're staying and learning.
58	And we know that our model works.
59	And we know this because a most recent randomized control evaluation confirms its efficacy.
60	Our evaluator found that over a three-year period Educate Girls was able to bring back 92 percent of all out-of-school girls back into school.
61	(Applause)
62	And in terms of learning, our children's learning went up significantly as compared to control schools.
63	So much so, that it was like an additional year of schooling for the average student.
64	And that's enormous, when you think about a tribal child who's entering the school system for the first time.
65	So here we have a model that works; we know it's scalable, because we are already functioning at 13,000 villages.
66	We know it's smart, because of the use of data and technology.
67	We know that it's sustainable and systemic, because we work in partnership with the community, it's actually led by the community.
68	And we work in partnership with the government, so there's no creation of a parallel delivery system.
69	And so because we have this innovative partnership with the community, the government, this smart model, we have this big, audacious dream today.
70	And that is to solve a full 40 percent of the problem of out-of-school girls in India in the next five years.
71	(Applause)
72	And you're thinking, that's a little ... You know, how am I even thinking about doing that, because India is not a small place, it's a huge country.
73	It's a country of over a billion people.
74	We have 650,000 villages.
75	How is it that I'm standing here, saying that one small organization is going to solve a full 40 percent of the problem?
76	And that's because we have a key insight.
77	And that is, because of our entire approach, with data and with technology, that five percent of villages in India have 40 percent of the out-of-school girls.
78	And this is a big, big piece of the puzzle.
79	Which means, I don't have to work across the entire country.
80	I have to work in those five percent of the villages, about 35,000 villages, to actually be able to solve a large piece of the problem.
81	And that's really key, because these villages not only have high burden of out-of-school girls, but also a lot of related indicators, right, like malnutrition, stunting, poverty, infant mortality, child marriage.
82	So by working and focusing here, you can actually create a large multiplier effect across all of these indicators.
83	And it would mean that we would be able to bring back 1.6 million girls back into school.
84	(Applause)
85	"I have to say, I have been doing this for over a decade, and I have never met a girl who said to me, you know, ""I want to stay at home,"" ""I want to graze the cattle,"" ""I want to look after the siblings,"" ""I want to be a child bride."""
86	Every single girl I meet wants to go to school.
87	And that's what we really want to do.
88	We want to be able to fulfill those 1.6 million dreams.
89	And it doesn't take much.
90	To find and enroll a girl with our model is about 20 dollars.
91	To make sure that she is learning and providing a learning program, it's another 40 dollars.
92	But today is the time to do it.
93	Because she is truly the biggest asset we have.
94	I am Safeena Husain, and I educate girls.
95	Thank you.
96	(Applause)
0	It’s late, pitch dark, and a self-driving car winds down a narrow country road.
1	Suddenly, three hazards appear at the same time.
2	What happens next?
3	Before it can navigate this onslaught of obstacles, the car has to detect them— gleaning enough information about their size, shape, and position, so that its control algorithms can plot the safest course.
4	With no human at the wheel, the car needs smart eyes, sensors that’ll resolve these details— no matter the environment, weather, or how dark it is— all in a split-second.
5	That’s a tall order, but there’s a solution that partners two things: a special kind of laser-based probe called LIDAR, and a miniature version of the communications technology that keeps the internet humming, called integrated photonics.
6	To understand LIDAR, it helps to start with a related technology— radar.
7	In aviation, radar antennas launch pulses of radio or microwaves at planes to learn their locations by timing how long the beams take to bounce back.
8	That’s a limited way of seeing, though, because the large beam-size can’t visualize fine details.
9	In contrast, a self-driving car’s LIDAR system, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, uses a narrow invisible infrared laser.
10	It can image features as small as the button on a pedestrian’s shirt across the street.
11	But how do we determine the shape, or depth, of these features?
12	LIDAR fires a train of super-short laser pulses to give depth resolution.
13	Take the moose on the country road.
14	As the car drives by, one LIDAR pulse scatters off the base of its antlers, while the next may travel to the tip of one antler before bouncing back.
15	Measuring how much longer the second pulse takes to return provides data about the antler’s shape.
16	With a lot of short pulses, a LIDAR system quickly renders a detailed profile.
17	The most obvious way to create a pulse of light is to switch a laser on and off.
18	But this makes a laser unstable and affects the precise timing of its pulses, which limits depth resolution.
19	Better to leave it on, and use something else to periodically block the light reliably and rapidly.
20	That’s where integrated photonics come in.
21	The digital data of the internet is carried by precision-timed pulses of light, some as short as a hundred picoseconds.
22	One way to create these pulses is with a Mach-Zehnder modulator.
23	This device takes advantage of a particular wave property, called interference.
24	Imagine dropping pebbles into a pond: as the ripples spread and overlap, a pattern forms.
25	In some places, wave peaks add up to become very large; in other places, they completely cancel out.
26	The Mach-Zehnder modulator does something similar.
27	It splits waves of light along two parallel arms and eventually rejoins them.
28	If the light is slowed down and delayed in one arm, the waves recombine out of sync and cancel, blocking the light.
29	By toggling this delay in one arm, the modulator acts like an on/off switch, emitting pulses of light.
30	A light pulse lasting a hundred picoseconds leads to a depth resolution of a few centimeters, but tomorrow’s cars will need to see better than that.
31	By pairing the modulator with a super- sensitive, fast-acting light detector, the resolution can be refined to a millimeter.
32	That’s more than a hundred times better  than what we can make out with 20/20 vision, from across a street.
33	The first generation of automobile LIDAR has relied on complex spinning assemblies that scan from rooftops or hoods.
34	With integrated photonics, modulators and detectors are being shrunk to less than a tenth of a millimeter, and packed into tiny chips that’ll one day fit inside a car’s lights.
35	These chips will also include a clever variation on the modulator to help do away with moving parts and scan at rapid speeds.
36	By slowing the light in a modulator arm only a tiny bit, this additional device will act more like a dimmer than an on/off switch.
37	If an array of many such arms, each with a tiny controlled delay, is stacked in parallel, something novel can be designed: a steerable laser beam.
38	From their new vantage, these smart eyes will probe and see more thoroughly than anything nature could’ve imagined— and help navigate any number of obstacles.
39	All without anyone breaking a sweat— except for maybe one disoriented moose.
0	It’s an increasingly common sight in hospitals around the world: a nurse measures our height, weight, blood pressure, and attaches a glowing plastic clip to our finger.
1	Suddenly, a digital screen reads out the oxygen level in our bloodstream.
2	How did that happen?
3	How can a plastic clip learn something about our blood… without a blood sample?
4	Here’s the trick: our bodies are translucent, meaning they don’t completely block and reflect light.
5	Rather, they allow some light to actually pass through our skin, muscles, and blood vessels.
6	Don’t believe it?
7	Hold a flashlight to your thumb.
8	Light, it turns out, can help probe the insides of our bodies.
9	Consider that medical fingerclip— it’s called a pulse oximeter.
10	When you inhale, your lungs transfer oxygen into hemoglobin molecules, and the pulse oximeter measures the ratio of oxygenated to oxygen-free hemoglobin.
11	It does this by using a tiny red LED light on one side of the fingerclip, and a small light detector on the other.
12	When the LED shines into your finger, oxygen-free hemoglobin in your blood vessels absorbs the red light more strongly than its oxygenated counterpart.
13	So the amount of light that makes it out the other side depends on the concentration ratio of the two types of hemoglobin.
14	But any two patients will have different-sized blood vessels in their fingers.
15	For one patient, a saturation reading of ninety-five percent corresponds to a healthy oxygen level, but for another with smaller arteries, the same reading could dangerously misrepresent the actual oxygen level.
16	This can be accounted for with a second infrared wavelength LED.
17	Light comes in a vast spectrum of wavelengths, and infrared light lies just beyond the visible colors.
18	All molecules, including hemoglobin, absorb light at different efficiencies across this spectrum.
19	So contrasting the absorbance of red to infrared light provides a chemical fingerprint to eliminate the blood vessel size effect.
20	Today, an emerging medical sensor industry is exploring all-new degrees of precision chemical fingerprinting, using tiny light-manipulating devices no larger than a tenth of a millimeter.
21	This microscopic technology, called integrated photonics, is made from wires of silicon that guide light— like water in a pipe— to redirect, reshape, even temporarily trap it.
22	A ring resonator device, which is a circular wire of silicon, is a light trapper that enhances chemical fingerprinting.
23	When placed close to a silicon wire, a ring siphons off and temporarily stores only certain waves of light— those whose periodic wavelength fits a whole number of times along the ring’s circumference.
24	It’s the same effect at work when we pluck guitar strings.
25	Only certain vibrating patterns dominate a string of a particular length, to give a fundamental note and its overtones.
26	Ring resonators were originally designed to efficiently route different wavelengths of light— each a channel of digital data— in fiber optics communication networks.
27	But some day this kind of data traffic routing may be adapted for miniature chemical fingerprinting labs, on chips the size of a penny.
28	These future labs-on-a-chip may easily, rapidly, and non-invasively detect a host of illnesses, by analyzing human saliva or sweat in a doctor’s office or the convenience of our homes.
29	Human saliva in particular mirrors the composition of our bodies’ proteins and hormones, and can give early-warning signals for certain cancers and infectious and autoimmune diseases.
30	To accurately identify an illness, labs-on-a-chip may rely on several methods, including chemical fingerprinting, to sift through the large mix of trace substances in a sample of spit.
31	Various biomolecules in saliva absorb light at the same wavelength— but each has a distinct chemical fingerprint.
32	In a lab-on-a-chip, after the light passes through a saliva sample, a host of fine-tuned rings may each siphon off a slightly different wavelength of light and send it to a partner light detector.
33	Together, this bank of detectors will resolve the cumulative chemical fingerprint of the sample.
34	From this information, a tiny on-chip computer, containing a library of chemical fingerprints for different molecules, may figure out their relative concentrations, and help diagnose a specific illness.
35	From globe-trotting communications to labs-on-a-chip, humankind has repurposed light to both carry and extract information.
36	Its ability to illuminate continues to astonish us with new discoveries.
0	In 2012, a team of Japanese and Danish researchers set a world record, transmitting 1 petabit of data— that’s 10,000 hours of high-def video— over a fifty-kilometer cable, in a second.
1	This wasn’t just any cable.
2	It was a souped-up version of fiber optics— the hidden network that links our planet and makes the internet possible.
3	For decades, long-distance communications between cities and countries were carried by electrical signals, in wires made of copper.
4	This was slow and inefficient, with metal wires limiting data rates and power lost as wasted heat.
5	But in the late 20th century, engineers mastered a far superior method of transmission.
6	Instead of metal, glass can be carefully melted and drawn into flexible fiber strands, hundreds of kilometers long and no thicker than human hair.
7	And instead of electricity, these strands carry pulses of light, representing digital data.
8	But how does light travel within glass, rather than just pass through it?
9	The trick lies in a phenomenon known as total internal reflection.
10	Since Isaac Newton’s time, lensmakers and scientists have known that light bends when it passes between air and materials like water or glass.
11	When a ray of light inside glass hits its surface at a steep angle, it refracts, or bends as it exits into air.
12	But if the ray travels at a shallow angle, it’ll bend so far that it stays trapped, bouncing along inside the glass.
13	Under the right condition, something normally transparent to light can instead hide it from the world.
14	Compared to electricity or radio, fiber optic signals barely degrade over great distances— a little power does scatter away, and fibers can’t bend too sharply, otherwise the light leaks out.
15	Today, a single optical fiber carries many wavelengths of light, each a different channel of data.
16	And a fiber optic cable contains hundreds of these fiber strands.
17	Over a million kilometers of cable crisscross our ocean floors to link the continents— that’s enough to wind around the Equator nearly thirty times.
18	With fiber optics, distance hardly limits data, which has allowed the internet to evolve into a planetary computer.
19	Increasingly, our mobile work and play rely on legions of overworked computer servers, warehoused in gigantic data centers flung across the world.
20	This is called cloud computing, and it leads to two big problems: heat waste and bandwidth demand.
21	The vast majority of internet traffic shuttles around inside data centers, where thousands of servers are connected by traditional electrical cables.
22	Half of their running power is wasted as heat.
23	Meanwhile, wireless bandwidth demand steadily marches on, and the gigahertz signals used in our mobile devices are reaching their data delivery limits.
24	It seems fiber optics has been too good for its own good, fueling overly-ambitious cloud and mobile computing expectations.
25	But a related technology, integrated photonics, has come to the rescue.
26	Light can be guided not only in optical fibers, but also in ultrathin silicon wires.
27	Silicon wires don’t guide light as well as fiber.
28	But they do enable engineers to shrink all the devices in a hundred kilometer fiber optic network down to tiny photonic chips that plug into servers and convert their electrical signals to optical and back.
29	These electricity-to-light chips allow for wasteful electrical cables in data centers to be swapped out for power-efficient fiber.
30	Photonic chips can help break open wireless bandwidth limitations, too.
31	Researchers are working to replace mobile gigahertz signals with terahertz frequencies, to carry data thousands of times faster.
32	But these are short-range signals: they get absorbed by moisture in the air, or blocked by tall buildings.
33	With tiny wireless-to-fiber photonic transmitter chips distributed throughout cities, terahertz signals can be relayed over long-range distances.
34	They can do so via a stable middleman, optical fiber, and make hyperfast wireless connectivity a reality.
35	For all of human history, light has gifted us with sight and heat, serving as a steady companion while we explored and settled the physical world.
36	Now, we’ve saddled light with information and redirected it to run along a fiber optic superhighway— with many different integrated photonic exits— to build an even more expansive, virtual world.
0	Nobody likes to make a mistake.
1	And I made a whopping one.
2	And figuring out what I did wrong led to a discovery that completely changes the way we think about the Earth and Moon.
3	I'm a planetary scientist, and my favorite thing to do is smash planets together.
4	(Laughter)
5	In my lab, I can shoot at rocks using cannons like this one.
6	(Cannon shot)
7	(Laughter)
8	In my experiments, I can generate the extreme conditions during planet formation.
9	And with computer models, I can collide whole planets together to make them grow, or I can destroy them.
10	(Laughter)
11	I want to understand how to make the Earth and the Moon and why the Earth is so different from other planets.
12	"The leading idea for the origin of the Earth and Moon is called the ""giant impact theory."""
13	The theory states that a Mars-sized body struck the young Earth, and the Moon formed from the debris disk around the planet.
14	The theory can explain so many things about the Moon, but it has a huge flaw: it predicts that the Moon is mostly made from the Mars-sized planet, that the Earth and the Moon are made from different materials.
15	But that's not what we see.
16	The Earth and the Moon are actually like identical twins.
17	The genetic code of planets is written in the isotopes of the elements.
18	The Earth and Moon have identical isotopes.
19	That means that the Earth and Moon are made from the same materials.
20	It's really strange that the Earth and the Moon are twins.
21	All of the planets are made from different materials, so they all have different isotopes, they all have their own genetic code.
22	No other planetary bodies have the same genetic relationship.
23	Only the Earth and Moon are twins.
24	When I started working on the origin of the Moon, there were scientists that wanted to reject the whole idea of the giant impact.
25	They didn't see any way for this theory to explain the special relationship between the Earth and the Moon.
26	We were all trying to think of new ideas.
27	The problem was, there weren't any better ideas.
28	All of the other ideas had even bigger flaws.
29	So we were trying to rescue the giant impact theory.
30	A young scientist in my group suggested that we try changing the spin of the giant impact.
31	Maybe making the Earth spin faster could mix more material and explain the Moon.
32	The Mars-sized impactor had been chosen because it could make the Moon and make the length of Earth's day.
33	People really liked that part of the model.
34	But what if something else determined the length of Earth's day?
35	Then there would be many more possible giant impacts that could make the Moon.
36	I was curious about what could happen, so I tried simulating faster-spinning giant impacts, and I found that it is possible to make a disk out of the same mixture of materials as the planet.
37	We were pretty excited.
38	Maybe this was the way to explain the Moon.
39	The problem is, we also found that that's just not very likely.
40	Most of the time, the disk is different from the planet, and it looked like making our Moon this way would be an astronomical coincidence, and it was just hard for everyone to accept the idea that the Moon's special connection to Earth was an accident.
41	The giant impact theory was still in trouble, and we were still trying to figure out how to make the Moon.
42	Then came the day when I realized my mistake.
43	My student and I were looking at the data from these fast-spinning giant impacts.
44	On that day, we weren't actually thinking about the Moon, we were looking at the planet.
45	The planet gets super-hot and partially vaporized from the energy of the impact.
46	But the data didn't look like a planet.
47	It looked really strange.
48	The planet was weirdly connected to the disk.
49	I got that super-excited feeling when something really wrong might be something really interesting.
50	In all of my calculations, I had assumed there was a planet with a separate disk around it.
51	Calculating what was in the disk as how we tested whether an impact could make the Moon.
52	But it didn't look that simple anymore.
53	We were making the mistake of thinking that a planet was always going to look like a planet.
54	On that day, I knew that a giant impact was making something completely new.
55	I've had eureka moments.
56	This was not one of them.
57	(Laughter)
58	I really didn't know what was going on.
59	I had this strange, new object in front of me and the challenge to try and figure it out.
60	What do you do when faced with the unknown?
61	How do you even start?
62	We questioned everything: What is a planet?
63	When is a planet no longer a planet anymore?
64	We played with new ideas.
65	We had to get rid of our old way of thinking, and by playing, I could throw away all of the data, all of the rules of the real world, and free my mind to explore.
66	And by making a mental space where I could try out outrageous ideas and then bring them back into the real world to test them, I could learn.
67	And by playing, we learned so much.
68	I combined my lab experiments with computer models and discovered that after most giant impacts, the Earth is so hot, there's no surface.
69	There's just a deep layer of gas that gets denser and denser with depth.
70	The Earth would have been like Jupiter.
71	There's nothing to stand on.
72	And that was just part of the problem.
73	I wanted to understand the whole problem.
74	I couldn't let go of the challenge to figure out what was really going on in giant impacts.
75	It took almost two years of throwing away old ideas and building new ones that we understood the data and knew what it meant for the Moon.
76	I discovered a new type of astronomical object.
77	It's not a planet.
78	It's made from planets.
79	A planet is a body whose self-gravity is strong enough to give it its rounded shape.
80	It spins around all together.
81	Make it hotter and spin it faster, the equator gets bigger and bigger until it reaches a tipping point.
82	Push past the tipping point, and the material at the equator spreads into a disk.
83	It's now broken all the rules of being a planet.
84	It can't spin around together anymore, its shape keeps changing as it gets bigger and bigger; the planet has become something new.
85	We gave our discovery its name: synestia.
86	We named it after the goddess Hestia, the Greek goddess of the hearth and home, because we think the Earth became one.
87	"The prefix means ""all together,"" to emphasize the connection between all of the material."
88	A synestia is what a planet becomes when heat and spin push it over the limit of a spheroidal shape.
89	Would you like to see a synestia?
90	(Cheers)
91	In this visualization of one of my simulations, the young Earth is already spinning quickly from a previous giant impact.
92	Its shape is deformed, but our planet would be recognizable by the water on its surface.
93	The energy from the impact vaporizes the surface, the water, the atmosphere, and mixes all of the gases together in just a few hours.
94	We discovered that many giant impacts make synestias, but these burning, bright objects don't live very long.
95	They cool down, shrink and turn back into planets.
96	While rocky planets like Earth were growing, they probably turned into synestias one or more times.
97	A synestia gives us a new way to solve the problem of the origin of the Moon.
98	We propose that the Moon formed inside a huge, vaporous synestia.
99	The Moon grew from magma rain that condensed out of the rock vapor.
100	The Moon's special connection to Earth is because the Moon formed inside the Earth when Earth was a synestia.
101	The Moon could have orbited inside the synestia for years, hidden from view.
102	The Moon is revealed by the synestia cooling and shrinking inside of its orbit.
103	The synestia turns into planet Earth only after cooling for hundreds of years longer.
104	In our new theory, the giant impact makes a synestia, and the synestia divides into two new bodies, creating our isotopically identical Earth and Moon.
105	Synestias have been created throughout the universe.
106	And we only just realized that by finding them in our imagination: What else am I missing in the world around me?
107	What is hidden from my view by my own assumptions?
108	The next time you look at the Moon, remember: the things you think you know may be the opportunity to discover something truly amazing.

0	Chris Anderson: Shep, thank you so much for coming.
1	I think your plane landed literally two hours ago in Vancouver.
2	Such a treat to have you.
3	So, talk us through how do you get from Einstein's equation to a black hole?
4	Sheperd Doeleman: Over 100 years ago, Einstein came up with this geometric theory of gravity which deforms space-time.
5	So, matter deforms space-time, and then space-time tells matter in turn how to move around it.
6	And you can get enough matter into a small enough region that it punctures space-time, and that even light can't escape, the force of gravity keeps even light inside.
7	CA: And so, before that, the reason the Earth moves around the Sun is not because the Sun is pulling the Earth as we think, but it's literally changed the shape of space so that we just sort of fall around the Sun.
8	SD: Exactly, the geometry of space-time tells the Earth how to move around the Sun.
9	You're almost seeing a black hole puncture through space-time, and when it goes so deeply in, then there's a point at which light orbits the black hole.
10	CA: And so that's, I guess, is what's happening here.
11	This is not an image, this is a computer simulation of what we always thought, like, the event horizon around the black hole.
12	SD: Until last week, we had no idea what a black hole really looked like.
13	The best we could do were simulations like this in supercomputers, but even here you see this ring of light, which is the orbit of photons.
14	That's where photons literally move around the black hole, and around that is this hot gas that's drawn to the black hole, and it's hot because of friction.
15	All this gas is trying to get into a very small volume, so it heats up.
16	CA: A few years ago, you embarked on this mission to try and actually image one of these things.
17	And I guess you took — you focused on this galaxy way out there.
18	Tell us about this galaxy.
19	SD: This is the galaxy — we're going to zoom into the galaxy M87, it's 55 million light-years away.
20	CA: Fifty-five million.
21	SD: Which is a long way.
22	And at its heart, there's a six-and-a-half-billion- solar-mass black hole.
23	That's hard for us to really fathom, right?
24	Six and a half billion suns compressed into a single point.
25	And it's governing some of the energetics of the center of this galaxy.
26	CA: But even though that thing is so huge, because it's so far away, to actually dream of getting an image of it, that's incredibly hard.
27	The resolution would be incredible that you need.
28	SD: Black holes are the smallest objects in the known universe.
29	But they have these outsize effects on whole galaxies.
30	But to see one, you would need to build a telescope as large as the Earth, because the black hole that we're looking at gives off copious radio waves.
31	It's emitting all the time.
32	CA: And that's exactly what you did.
33	SD: Exactly.
34	What you're seeing here is we used telescopes all around the world, we synchronized them perfectly with atomic clocks, so they received the light waves from this black hole, and then we stitched all of that data together to make an image.
35	CA: To do that the weather had to be right in all of those locations at the same time, so you could actually get a clear view.
36	SD: We had to get lucky in a lot of different ways.
37	And sometimes, it's better to be lucky than good.
38	In this case, we were both, I like to think.
39	But light had to come from the black hole.
40	It had to come through intergalactic space, through the Earth's atmosphere, where water vapor can absorb it, and everything worked out perfectly, the size of the Earth at that wavelength of light, one millimeter wavelength, was just right to resolve that black hole, 55 million light-years away.
41	The universe was telling us what to do.
42	CA: So you started capturing huge amounts of data.
43	I think this is like half the data from just one telescope.
44	SD: Yeah, this is one of the members of our team, Lindy Blackburn, and he's sitting with half the data recorded at the Large Millimeter Telescope, which is atop a 15,000-foot mountain in Mexico.
45	And what he's holding there is about half a petabyte.
46	Which, to put it in terms that we might understand, it's about 5,000 people's lifetime selfie budget.
47	(Laughter)
48	CA: It's a lot of data.
49	So this was all shipped, you couldn't send this over the internet.
50	All this data was shipped to one place and the massive computer effort began to try and analyze it.
51	And you didn't really know what you were going to see coming out of this.
52	SD: The way this technique works that we used — imagine taking an optical mirror and smashing it and putting all the shards in different places.
53	The way a normal mirror works is the light rays bounce off the surface, which is perfect, and they focus in a certain point at the same time.
54	We take all these recordings, and with atomic clock precision we align them perfectly, later in a supercomputer.
55	And we recreate kind of an Earth-sized lens.
56	And the only way to do that is to bring the data back by plane.
57	You can't beat the bandwidth of a 747 filled with hard discs.
58	(Laughter)
59	CA: And so, I guess a few weeks or a few months ago, on a computer screen somewhere, this started to come into view.
60	This moment.
61	SD: Well, it took a long time.
62	CA: I mean, look at this.
63	That was it.
64	That was the first image.
65	(Applause)
66	So tell us what we're really looking at there.
67	SD: I still love it.
68	(Laughter)
69	So what you're seeing is that last orbit of photons.
70	You're seeing Einstein's geometry laid bare.
71	The puncture in space-time is so deep that light moves around in orbit, so that light behind the black hole, as I think we'll see soon, moves around and comes to us on these parallel lines at exactly that orbit.
72	It turns out, that orbit is the square root of 27 times just a handful of fundamental constants.
73	It's extraordinary when you think about it.
74	CA: When ...
75	In my head, initially, when I thought of black holes, I'm thinking that is the event horizon, there's lots of matter and light whirling around in that shape.
76	But it's actually more complicated than that.
77	Well, talk us through this animation, because it's light being lensed around it.
78	SD: You'll see here that some light from behind it gets lensed, and some light does a loop-the-loop around the entire orbit of the black hole.
79	But when you get enough light from all this hot gas swirling around the black hole, then you wind up seeing all of these light rays come together on this screen, which is a stand-in for where you and I are.
80	And you see the definition of this ring begin to come into shape.
81	And that's what Einstein predicted over 100 years ago.
82	CA: Yeah, that is amazing.
83	So tell us more about what we're actually looking at here.
84	First of all, why is part of it brighter than the rest?
85	SD: So what's happening is that the black hole is spinning.
86	And you wind up with some of the gas moving towards us below and receding from us on the top.
87	And just as the train whistle has a higher pitch when it's coming towards you, there's more energy from the gas coming towards us than going away from us.
88	You see the bottom part brighter because the light is actually being boosted in our direction.
89	CA: And how physically big is that?
90	SD: Our entire solar system would fit well within that dark region.
91	And if I may, that dark region is the signature of the event horizon.
92	The reason we don't see light from there, is that the light that would come to us from that place was swallowed by the event horizon.
93	So that — that's it.
94	CA: And so when we think of a black hole, you think of these huge rays jetting out of it, which are pointed directly in our direction.
95	Why don't we see them?
96	SD: This is a very powerful black hole.
97	Not by universal standards, it's still powerful, and from the north and south poles of this black hole we think that jets are coming.
98	Now, we're too close to really see all the jet structure, but it's the base of those jets that are illuminating the space-time.
99	And that's what's being bent around the black hole.
100	CA: And if you were in a spaceship whirling around that thing somehow, how long would it take to actually go around it?
101	SD: First, I would give anything to be in that spaceship.
102	(Laughter)
103	Sign me up.
104	There’s something called the — if I can get wonky for one moment — the innermost stable circular orbit, that's the innermost orbit at which matter can move around a black hole before it spirals in.
105	And for this black hole, it's going to be between three days and about a month.
106	CA: It's so powerful, it's weirdly slow at one level.
107	I mean, you wouldn't even notice falling into that event horizon if you were there.
108	"SD: So you may have heard of ""spaghettification,"" where you fall into a black hole and the gravitational field on your feet is much stronger than on your head, so you're ripped apart."
109	This black hole is so big that you're not going to become a spaghetti noodle.
110	You're just going to drift right through that event horizon.
111	CA: So, it's like a giant tornado.
112	When Dorothy was whipped by a tornado, she ended up in Oz.
113	Where do you end up if you fall into a black hole?
114	(Laughter)
115	SD: Vancouver.
116	(Laughter)
117	CA: Oh, my God.
118	(Applause)
119	It's the red circle, that's terrifying.
120	No, really.
121	SD: Black holes really are the central mystery of our age, because that's where the quantum world and the gravitational world come together.
122	What's inside is a singularity.
123	And that's where all the forces become unified, because gravity finally is strong enough to compete with all the other forces.
124	But it's hidden from us, the universe has cloaked it in the ultimate invisibility cloak.
125	So we don't know what happens in there.
126	CA: So there's a smaller one of these in our own galaxy.
127	Can we go back to our own beautiful galaxy?
128	This is the Milky Way, this is home.
129	And somewhere in the middle of that there's another one, which you're trying to find as well.
130	SD: We already know it's there, and we've already taken data on it.
131	And we're working on those data right now.
132	So we hope to have something in the near future, I can't say when.
133	CA: It's way closer but also a lot smaller, maybe the similar kind of size to what we saw?
134	SD: Right.
135	So it turns out that the black hole in M87, that we saw before, is six and a half billion solar masses.
136	But it's so far away that it appears a certain size.
137	The black hole in the center of our galaxy is a thousand times less massive, but also a thousand times closer.
138	So it looks the same angular size on the sky.
139	CA: Finally, I guess, a nod to a remarkable group of people.
140	Who are these guys?
141	SD: So these are only some of the team.
142	We marveled at the resonance that this image has had.
143	If you told me that it would be above the fold in all of these newspapers, I'm not sure I would have believed you, but it was.
144	Because this is a great mystery, and it's inspiring for us, and I hope it's inspiring to everyone.
145	But the more important thing is that this is just a small number of the team.
146	We're 200 people strong with 60 institutes and 20 countries and regions.
147	If you want to build a global telescope you need a global team.
148	And this technique that we use of linking telescopes around the world kind of effortlessly sidesteps some of the issues that divide us.
149	And as scientists, we naturally come together to do something like this.
150	CA: Wow, boy, that's inspiring for our whole team this week.
151	Shep, thank you so much for what you did and for coming here.
152	SD: Thank you.
153	(Applause)
0	Growing up in northern Wisconsin, I've naturally developed a connection to the Mississippi River.
1	"When I was little, my sister and I would have contests to see who could spell ""M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i"" the fastest."
2	When I was in elementary school, I got to learn about the early explorers and their expeditions, Marquette and Joliet, and how they used the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River and its tributaries to discover the Midwest, and to map a trade route to the Gulf of Mexico.
3	In graduate school, I was fortunate to have the Mississippi River outside my research laboratory window at the University of Minnesota.
4	During that five-year period, I got to know the Mississippi River.
5	I got to know its temperamental nature and where it would flood its banks at one moment, and then shortly thereafter, you would see its dry shorelines.
6	Today, as a physical organic chemist, I'm committed to use my training to help protect rivers, like the Mississippi, from excessive salt that can come from human activity.
7	Because, you know, salt is something that can contaminate freshwater rivers.
8	And freshwater rivers, they have only salt levels of .05 percent.
9	And at this level, it's safe to drink.
10	But the majority of the water on our planet is housed in our oceans, and ocean water has a salinity level of more than three percent.
11	And if you drank that, you'd be sick very quick.
12	So, if we are to compare the relative volume of ocean water to that of the river water that's on our planet, and let's say we are able to put the ocean water into an Olympic-size swimming pool, then our planet's river water would fit in a one-gallon jug.
13	So you can see it's a precious resource.
14	But do we treat it like a precious resource?
15	Or rather, do we treat it like that old rug that you put in your front doorway and wipe your feet off on it?
16	Treating rivers like that old rug has severe consequences.
17	Let's take a look.
18	Let's see what just one teaspoon of salt can do.
19	If we add one teaspoon of salt to this Olympic-size swimming pool of ocean water, the ocean water stays ocean water.
20	But if we add that same one teaspoon of salt to this one-gallon jug of fresh river water, suddenly, it becomes too salty to drink.
21	So the point here is, because rivers, the volume is so small compared to the oceans, it is especially vulnerable to human activity, and we need to take care to protect them.
22	So recently, I surveyed the literature to look at the river health around the world.
23	And I fully expected to see ailing river health in regions of water scarcity and heavy industrial development.
24	And I saw that in northern China and in India.
25	But I was surprised when I read a 2018 article where there's 232 river-sampling sites sampled across the United States.
26	And of those sites, 37 percent had increasing salinity levels.
27	What was more surprising is that the ones with the highest increases were found on the east part of the United States, and not the arid southwest.
28	The authors of this paper postulate that this could be due to using salt to deice roads.
29	Potentially, another source of this salt could come from salty industrial wastewaters.
30	So as you see, human activities can convert our freshwater rivers into water that's more like our oceans.
31	So we need to act and do something before it's too late.
32	And I have a proposal.
33	We can take a three-step river-defense mechanism, and if industrial-water users practice this defense mechanism, we can put our rivers in a much safer position.
34	This involves, number one, extracting less water from our rivers by implementing water recycle and reuse operations.
35	Number two, we need to take the salt out of these salty industrial wastewaters and recover it and reuse it for other purposes.
36	And number three, we need to convert salt consumers, who currently source our salt from mines into salt consumers that source our salt from recycled salt sources.
37	This three-part defense mechanism is already in play.
38	This is what northern China and India are implementing to help to rehabilitate the rivers.
39	But the proposal here is to use this defense mechanism to protect our rivers, so we don't need to rehabilitate them.
40	And the good news is, we have technology that can do this.
41	It's with membranes.
42	Membranes that can separate salt and water.
43	Membranes have been around for a number of years, and they're based on polymeric materials that separate based on size, or they can separate based on charge.
44	The membranes that are used to separate salt and water typically separate based on charge.
45	And these membranes are negatively charged, and help to repel the negatively charged chloride ions that are in that dissolved salt.
46	So, as I said, these membranes have been around for a number of years, and currently, they are purifying 25 million gallons of water every minute.
47	Even more than that, actually.
48	But they can do more.
49	These membranes are based under the principle of reverse osmosis.
50	Now osmosis is this natural process that happens in our bodies — you know, how our cells work.
51	And osmosis is where you have two chambers that separate two levels of salt concentration.
52	One with low salt concentration and one with high salt concentration.
53	And separating the two chambers is the semipermeable membrane.
54	And under the natural osmosis process, what happens is the water naturally transports across that membrane from the area of low salt concentration to the area of high salt concentration, until an equilibrium is met.
55	Now reverse osmosis, it's the reverse of this natural process.
56	And in order to achieve this reversal, what we do is we apply a pressure to the high-concentration side and in doing so, we drive the water the opposite direction.
57	And so the high-concentration side becomes more salty, more concentrated, and the low-concentration side becomes your purified water.
58	So using reverse osmosis, we can take an industrial wastewater and convert up to 95 percent of it into pure water, leaving only five percent as this concentrated salty mixture.
59	Now, this five percent concentrated salty mixture is not waste.
60	So scientists have also developed membranes that are modified to allow some salts to pass through and not others.
61	Using these membranes, which are commonly referred to as nanofiltration membranes, now this five percent concentrated salty solution can be converted into a purified salt solution.
62	So, in total, using reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes, we can convert industrial wastewater into a resource of both water and salt.
63	And in doing so, achieve pillars one and two of this river-defense mechanism.
64	"Now, I've introduced this to a number of industrial-water users, and the common response is, ""Yeah, but who is going to use my salt?"""
65	So that's why pillar number three is so important.
66	We need to transform folks that are using mine salt into consumers of recycled salt.
67	So who are these salt consumers?
68	Well, in 2018 in the United States, I learned that 43 percent of the salt consumed in the US was used for road salt deicing purposes.
69	Thirty-nine percent was used by the chemical industry.
70	So let's take a look at these two applications.
71	So, I was shocked.
72	In the 2018-2019 winter season, one million tons of salt was applied to the roads in the state of Pennsylvania.
73	One million tons of salt is enough to fill two-thirds of an Empire State Building.
74	That's one million tons of salt mined from the earth, applied to our roads, and then it washes off into the environment and into our rivers.
75	So the proposal here is that we could at least source that salt from a salty industrial wastewater, and prevent that from going into our rivers, and rather use that to apply to our roads.
76	So at least when the melt happens in the springtime and you have this high-salinity runoff, the rivers are at least in a better position to defend themselves against that.
77	Now, as a chemist, the opportunity though that I'm more psyched about is the concept of introducing circular salt into the chemical industry.
78	And the chlor-alkali industry is perfect.
79	Chlor-alkali industry is the source of epoxies, it's the source of urethanes and solvents and a lot of useful products that we use in our everyday lives.
80	And it uses sodium chloride salt as its key feed stack.
81	So the idea here is, well, first of all, let's look at linear economy.
82	So in a linear economy, they're sourcing that salt from a mine, it goes through this chlor-alkali process, made into a basic chemical, which then can get converted into another new product, or a more functional product.
83	But during that conversion process, oftentimes salt is regenerated as the by-product, and it ends up in the industrial wastewater.
84	So, the idea is that we can introduce circularity, and we can recycle the water and salt from those industrial wastewater streams, from the factories, and we can send it to the front end of the chlor-alkali process.
85	Circular salt.
86	So how impactful is this?
87	Well, let's just take one example.
88	Fifty percent of the world's production of propylene oxide is made through the chlor-alkali process.
89	And that's a total of about five million tons of propylene oxide on an annual basis, made globally.
90	So that's five million tons of salt mined from the earth converted through the chlor-alkali process into propylene oxide, and then during that process, five million tons of salt that ends up in wastewater streams.
91	So five million tons is enough salt to fill three Empire State Buildings.
92	And that's on an annual basis.
93	So you can see how circular salt can provide a barrier to our rivers from this excessive salty discharge.
94	"So you might wonder, ""Well, gosh, these membranes have been around for a number of years, so why aren't people implementing wastewater reuse?"
95	Well, the bottom line is, it costs money to implement wastewater reuse.
96	And second, water in these regions is undervalued.
97	Until it's too late.
98	You know, if we don't plan for freshwater sustainability, there are some severe consequences.
99	You can just ask one of the world's largest chemical manufacturers who last year took a 280-million dollar hit due to low river levels of the Rhine River in Germany.
100	You can ask the residents of Cape Town, South Africa, who experienced a year-over-year drought drying up their water reserves, and then being asked not to flush their toilets.
101	So you can see, we have solutions here, with membranes, where we can provide pure water, we can provide pure salt, using these membranes, both of these, to help to protect our rivers for future generations.
102	Thank you.
103	(Applause)
0	David Biello: So Victor, what have you been up to?
1	Victor Vescovo: That's the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, and I guess I read too much Jules Verne as a young boy, and so for the last four years I've led a team to design and build what is now the most advanced and deepest diving submersible on the planet, and I have the ability to personally pilot it too.
2	So this was us in December of last year, for the first time — the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.
3	DB: And nobody's seen that before right?
4	That's just you.
5	VV: No.
6	Well, now everybody else.
7	DB: Who does that?
8	Like —
9	VV: Well, I think everyone has seen the developments in the last 10, 15 years.
10	You have a bunch of people that have the means to explore outer space, like SpaceX or Blue Origin — those guys — and we're going the other direction.
11	So it's a wonderful era of private individuals spending their resources to develop technologies that can take us to places that have never been explored before, and the oceans of the world is — it's almost a cliché to say it's 70 percent of our entire planet, and of that, 95 percent is unexplored.
12	So what we're trying to do with our expedition is to build and prove out a submersible that can go to any point on the bottom of the planet to explore the 60 percent of this planet that is still unexplored.
13	DB: You need a pretty cool tool to do that, right?
14	VV: Right.
15	Now the tool is the submarine, the Limiting Factor.
16	It's a state-of-the-art vessel supported by the support ship, the Pressure Drop.
17	It has a two-person titanium sphere, 90 millimeters-thick, that keeps it at one atmosphere, and it has the ability to dive repeatedly down to the very deepest point of the ocean.
18	DB: So like the SpaceX of ocean exploration?
19	VV: Yeah, it's kind of the SpaceX of ocean exploration, but I pilot my own vehicles.
20	(Laughter)
21	DB: Are you going to take Elon or...?
22	VV: Yeah, I could take someone down there.
23	So, Elon, if you're listening, I'll give you a ride in mine if you give me a ride in yours.
24	(Laughter)
25	DB: So tell us what it's like down there.
26	I mean, we're talking about a place where the pressure is so intense that it's like putting an Eiffel Tower on your toe.
27	VV: It's more than that.
28	It's about 16,000 psi.
29	So the issue is that we have this titanium sphere that allows us to go down to these extreme depths and come up repeatedly.
30	That's never been done before.
31	The Challenger Deep has been dived twice, once in 1960 and once in 2012 by James Cameron, and they went down and came back up and those were experimental craft.
32	This is the first commercially certified submersible that can go up and down thousands of times with two people, including a scientist.
33	We're very proud that we took down the deepest-diving British citizen in history just three weeks ago, Dr. Alan Jamieson of Newcastle University who was down with us on the Java Trench.
34	DB: So, not too much freaks you out, is what I'm guessing.
35	VV: Well, it's a lot different to go diving.
36	If you're claustrophobic, you do not want to be in the submarine.
37	We go down quite a distance and the missions typically last eight to nine hours in a confined space.
38	It's very different from the career I had previously which was mountain climbing where you're in open spaces, the wind is whipping, it's very cold.
39	This is the opposite.
40	It's much more technical.
41	It's much more about precision in using the instruments and troubleshooting anything that can go wrong.
42	But if something really goes wrong in the submersible, you're not going to know it.
43	(Laughter)
44	DB: So you're afraid of leaks is what you're saying.
45	VV: Leaks are not good, but if it's a leak that's happening, it's not that bad because if it was really bad you wouldn't know it, again, but — you know, fire in the capsule, that wouldn't be good either, but it's actually a very safe submersible.
46	I like to say I don't trust a lot of things in life, but I do trust titanium, I trust math and I trust finite element analysis, which is how you figure out whether or not things like this can survive these extraordinary pressures and conditions.
47	DB: And that sphere is so perfectly machined, right?
48	This is a truly unique craft.
49	VV: That was the real trick — is actually building a titanium sphere that was accurate to within .1 percent of machine.
50	Titanium is a hard metal to work and a lot of people haven't figured it out, but we were very fortunate.
51	Our extraordinary team was able to make an almost perfect sphere, which when you're subjecting something to pressure, that's the strongest geometry you can have.
52	When I'm in the submersible and that hatch closes, I'm confident that I'm going to go down and come back up.
53	DB: And that's the thing you double-check — that the hatch is closed?
54	VV: There are only two rules in diving a submarine.
55	Number one is close the hatch securely.
56	Number two is go back to rule number one.
57	DB: Alright so, Atlantic Ocean: check.
58	Southern Ocean: check.
59	VV: No one has ever dived the Southern Ocean before.
60	I know why.
61	It's really, really hostile.
62	The weather is awful.
63	The word collision comes to mind.
64	But we did that one, yes.
65	Glad that's over — DB: Yeah —
66	VV: Thank you.
67	(Applause)
68	DB: It's like you're racing through it.
69	And now the Indian Ocean, as Kelly mentioned.
70	VV: Yeah, that was three weeks ago.
71	We were fortunate enough to actually solve the mystery.
72	"If someone had asked me three weeks ago, ""What is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean?"""
73	— no one really knew.
74	There were two candidates, one off of Western Australia and one in the Java Trench.
75	We have this wonderful ship with a brilliant sonar.
76	We mapped both of them.
77	We sent landers down to the bottom and verified.
78	It's actually in the center portion of the Java Trench, which is where no one thought it was.
79	In fact, every time we've completed one of our major dives, we have to run off to Wikipedia and change it because it's completely wrong.
80	(Laughter)
81	DB: So it probably takes longer to get down there than the time you're able to spend down there?
82	VV: No, we actually spend quite a bit of time.
83	I have four days of oxygen supply in the vessel.
84	If I'm down there for four days, something's gone so wrong I'm probably not going to use it, but it's about three hours down to the deepest part of the ocean and then we can spend usually three or four hours and then another three hours up.
85	So you don't want to stay in there for more than 10 or 11 hours.
86	It can get a little tight.
87	DB: Alright, so the bottom of the Indian Ocean.
88	And this is something that no one besides you has ever seen before —
89	VV: This is actually imagery from one of our robotic landers.
90	On the bottom right you can actually see a robust assfish — that's what it's actually called.
91	(Laughter)
92	But you can see from the left a creature that's never been seen before.
93	It's actually a bottom-dwelling jellyfish called a stalked ascidian, and none of them have ever looked like this before.
94	It actually has a small child at the bottom of its stalk, and it just drifted across beautifully.
95	So every single dive we have gone on, even though we're only down there for a couple of hours, we have found three or four new species because these are places that have been isolated for billions of years and no human being has ever been down there to film them or take samples.
96	And so this is extraordinary for us —
97	(Applause)
98	So what we are hoping — the main objective of our mission is to build this tool.
99	This tool is a door, because with this tool, we'll be able to make more of them potentially and take scientists down to do thousands of dives, to open that door to exploration and find things that we had no idea even existed.
100	DB: And so more people have been to space than the bottom of the ocean.
101	You're one of three.
102	You're going to up that number, you're going to give it away.
103	VV: Yeah, three people have dived to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.
104	The USS Trieste in 1960 with two individuals.
105	James Cameron in 2012 with his Deep Sea Challenger — thank you, Jim, great sub.
106	This is a third-generation technology.
107	We're not only going to try and go down, actually in two weeks, but we're going to try and do it multiple times, which has never been done before.
108	If we can do that, we'll have proven the technology and that door will not just go open, it will stay open.
109	(Applause)
110	DB: Fantastic.
111	Good luck.
112	VV: Thank you very much.
113	DB: Thank you.
114	VV: Thank you all.
115	(Applause)
0	We live in a vast universe, on a small wet planet, where billions of years ago single-celled life forms evolved from the same elements as all non-living material around them, proliferating and radiating into an incredible ray of complex life forms.
1	All of this— living and inanimate, microscopic and cosmic— is governed by mathematical laws with apparently arbitrary constants.
2	And this opens up a question: If the universe is completely governed by these laws, couldn’t a powerful enough computer simulate it exactly?
3	Could our reality actually be an incredibly detailed simulation set in place by a much more advanced civilization?
4	This idea may sound like science fiction, but it has been the subject of serious inquiry.
5	Philosopher Nick Bostrom advanced a compelling argument that we’re likely living in a simulation, and some scientists also think it’s a possibility.
6	These scientists have started thinking about experimental tests to find out whether our universe is a simulation.
7	They are hypothesizing about what the constraints of the simulation might be, and how those constraints could lead to detectable signs in the world.
8	So where might we look for those glitches?
9	One idea is that as a simulation runs, it might accumulate errors over time.
10	To correct for these errors the simulators could adjust the constants in the laws of nature.
11	These shifts could be tiny— for instance, certain constants we’ve measured with accuracies of parts per million have stayed steady for decades, so any drift would have to be on an even smaller scale.
12	But as we gain more precision in our measurements of these constants, we might detect slight changes over time.
13	Another possible place to look comes from the concept that finite computing power, no matter how huge, can’t simulate infinities.
14	If space and time are continuous, then even a tiny piece of the universe has infinite points and becomes impossible to simulate with finite computing power.
15	So a simulation would have to represent space and time in very small pieces.
16	These would be almost incomprehensibly tiny.
17	But we might be able to search for them by using certain subatomic particles as probes.
18	The basic principle is this: the smaller something is, the more sensitive it will be to disruption— think of hitting a pothole on a skateboard versus in a truck.
19	Any unit in space-time would be so small that most things would travel through it without disruption— not just objects large enough to be visible to the naked eye, but also molecules, atoms, and even electrons and most of the other subatomic particles we’ve discovered.
20	If we do discover a tiny unit in space-time or a shifting constant in a natural law, would that prove the universe is a simulation?
21	No— it would only be the first of many steps.
22	There could be other explanations for each of those findings.
23	And a lot more evidence would be needed to establish the simulation hypothesis as a working theory of nature.
24	However many tests we design, we’re limited by some assumptions they all share.
25	Our current understanding of the natural world on the quantum level breaks down at what’s known as the planck scale.
26	If the unit of space-time is on this scale, we wouldn’t be able to look for it with our current scientific understanding.
27	There’s still a wide range of things that are smaller than what’s currently observable but larger than the planck scale to investigate.
28	Similarly, shifts in the constants of natural laws could occur so slowly that they would only be observable over the lifetime of the universe.
29	So they could exist even if we don’t detect them over centuries or millennia of measurements.
30	We're also biased towards thinking that our universe’s simulator, if it exists, makes calculations the same way we do, with similar computational limitations.
31	Really, we have no way of knowing what an alien civilization’s constraints and methods would be— but we have to start somewhere.
32	It may never be possible to prove conclusively that the universe either is, or isn’t, a simulation, but we’ll always be pushing science and technology forward in pursuit of the question: what is the nature of reality?
